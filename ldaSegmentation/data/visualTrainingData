Support for customized two and three finger click.*|*|* - Screen. Bright and easy to read at 30 degree angles.*|*|* - Battery life. Yes, it will do over 10 hours.*|*|* - Weight/size. 1 inch thin and very light.- Body. Love the brushed black metal look on the case.*|*|* - Asus facial recognition login. Didn't think that I would care, but it's nice to have the computer log in, without touch, when I'm sitting in front of it. Asus FastBoot (not the BIOS fast boot). This lets you configure which programs load during startup and which load after. Speeds up the boot quite a bit.*|*|* - Decent speakers. Not ear-destroying, but suitable for the size. Much better than most netbooks.*|*|* Cons- Placement of touchpad. It still registers my palm as I'm typing even at the extreme setting. Downloaded the new touchpad driver, but that didn't fix.  Still looking for a solution. This is by far the most frustrating problem.UPDATE: The TouchFreeze utility seems to almost fix the issue.*|*|* - Case still shows fingerprints.*|*|* - Web cam is low res and has difficulty in low light (haven't tried different drivers yet).", 'id': 19, 'realTags': [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]}

It is large, and has a clickable button built in that is neat to use. From what I can see, the computer doesn't seem too fragile, and there isn't anything hanging off that can get snagged.*|*|* As for the Operating System: Chrome OS is great, if you know what it is all about. This computer is not for the person who is set in their ways of having certain programs they use every day, such as iTunes, Photoshop, MS Office. You can not install these programs on the Chromebook. That being said, there are many applications that can take place of these programs. Google Docs is a stripped down MS Office that has the same basic functionality. There are several music apps that would be happy to let you store your music library on them. Google is constantly updating the software and bringing more functionality to Chrome OS as well.*|*|* No frills, no viruses to get, minimal set-up, instant start up and shut down, and great hardware is a great experience. I highly recommend it.", 'id': 26, 'realTags': [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}

though. Amazon has it advertised as 1 TB 7200 Hard drive. Instead, it has 2 Western Digital 500 GB 7200 RPM drives which are very easy to access in terms of opening up the laptop and messing with hardware. I have not changed any hardware and do not intend to.*|*|* The screen is fantastic, the 1920x1080 res just makes everything look beautiful. The 17.3 inches is a little big but it's easy enough to carry around.*|*|* This laptop is not advertised as a gaming laptop but every game I have tried so far, Assassins Creed Franchise, Half Life 2, Team Fortress 2, and Sid Meier's Civilization 5, run perfectly with no lag even when running at full graphics. Today, I have spent almost 4 hours gaming without turning off or taking a break and the laptop external surface temp is room temperature if not a tad bit cooler.*|*|* The included subwoofer is a nice addition which virtually takes out all of the tinny sounds that laptops are almost infamous for. When I have blasted the speakers at their full capacity I was able to hear this laptop almost 75 ft away with no issues.*|*|* The computer does come with a decent amount of pre-installed software but nothing that can't be uninstalled via the control panel. Also, the side button on the side that can be programmed is very nice.*|*|*  Also, the case is classy and sophisticated. The brushed aluminium design makes the computer look sleek and professional.*|*|* I only have two complaints with it so far.1. The track pad. It looks nice and the concept with multi-gesture support is interesting, but it doesn't work. I don't like it. The pad is flimsy and a little over sized and the clicking is temperamental. However, this doesn't bother me too much because I use an external Logitech G500 mouse and I have disabled the track pad.2. The keyboard tends to stick when you press keys too hard but its barely noticeable when typing.*|*|* Overall, amazing laptop and I am very pleased with my purchase. If you are looking at the Asus N56VZ-DS71, the hardware is virtually the same, except for the hard drives and resolution size. I went with this one because the N56 has a 5400 rpm drive which causes severe bottleneck issues in terms of power.*|*|* On a side note, I was able to transfer roughly 50 GB of music from an external hard drive to this computer in under 10 minutes. I'm happy I spent the extra 100 dollars on this faster laptop, though I wish it was offered in the 16.3 inch size.*|*|* If you want to see an in depth video review, look up xoticpc Asus N76VZ-DS71 on youtube. They have a really nice 25 minute video review.*|*|* I chose to buy from amazon because at the time it was the better deal. Love the Asus name and this laptop.*|*|* UPDATEJust a couple things I have found after using this laptop for several months. It has an internal high quality microphone which I didn't realize at the time and that Amazon did not advertise.*|*|* Also, I was mistaken, the hard drives are not western digital, they are seagate.When you buy this laptop, the two hard drives are partitioned into 4 hard drives each containing roughly 256 gb. This is one thing I do not like and I didn't realize it until after I bought it and installed all of my software on.
