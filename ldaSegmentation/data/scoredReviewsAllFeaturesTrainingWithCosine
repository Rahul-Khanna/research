Amazon has it advertised as 1 TB 7200 Hard drive. Instead, it has 2 Western Digital 500 GB 7200 RPM drives which are very easy to access in terms of opening up the laptop and messing with hardware. I have not changed any hardware and do not intend to.*|*|* The screen is fantastic, the 1920x1080 res just makes everything look beautiful. The 17.3 inches is a little big but it's easy enough to carry around.*|*|* This laptop is not advertised as a gaming laptop but every game I have tried so far, Assassins Creed Franchise, Half Life 2, Team Fortress 2, and Sid Meier's Civilization 5, run perfectly with no lag even when running at full graphics. Today, I have spent almost 4 hours gaming without turning off or taking a break and the laptop external surface temp is room temperature if not a tad bit cooler.*|*|* The included subwoofer is a nice addition which virtually takes out all of the tinny sounds that laptops are almost infamous for. When I have blasted the speakers at their full capacity I was able to hear this laptop almost 75 ft away with no issues.*|*|* The computer does come with a decent amount of pre-installed software but nothing that can't be uninstalled via the control panel. Also, the side button on the side that can be programmed is very nice.*|*|*  Also, the case is classy and sophisticated. The brushed aluminium design makes the computer look sleek and professional.*|*|* I only have two complaints with it so far.1. The track pad. It looks nice and the concept with multi-gesture support is interesting, but it doesn't work. I don't like it. The pad is flimsy and a little over sized and the clicking is temperamental. However, this doesn't bother me too much because I use an external Logitech G500 mouse and I have disabled the track pad.2. The keyboard tends to stick when you press keys too hard but its barely noticeable when typing.*|*|* Overall, amazing laptop and I am very pleased with my purchase. If you are looking at the Asus N56VZ-DS71, the hardware is virtually the same, except for the hard drives and resolution size. I went with this one because the N56 has a 5400 rpm drive which causes severe bottleneck issues in terms of power.*|*|* On a side note, I was able to transfer roughly 50 GB of music from an external hard drive to this computer in under 10 minutes. I'm happy I spent the extra 100 dollars on this faster laptop, though I wish it was offered in the 16.3 inch size.*|*|* If you want to see an in depth video review, look up xoticpc Asus N76VZ-DS71 on youtube. They have a really nice 25 minute video review.*|*|* I chose to buy from amazon because at the time it was the better deal. Love the Asus name and this laptop.*|*|* UPDATEJust a couple things I have found after using this laptop for several months. It has an internal high quality microphone which I didn't realize at the time and that Amazon did not advertise.*|*|* Also, I was mistaken, the hard drives are not western digital, they are seagate.When you buy this laptop, the two hard drives are partitioned into 4 hard drives each containing roughly 256 gb. This is one thing I do not like and I didn't realize it until after I bought it and installed all of my software on. You can fix it but it requires you to format your hard drives which means losing windows 7 unless you made a recovery disk or something similar.*|*|* In my initial review, I said I hated the trackpad. After 2 months, I've gotten used to it and love the multi-gesture support system.*|*|* One last thing, recently I tripped while transporting it and fell on the laptop on concrete. True, the laptop was in a bag but I find it very impressive that I fell on it (I'm not a small guy) and it didn't even take cosmetic damage and continues to function perfectly.", 'id': 30, 'realTags': [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}

Yes,I felt "some" heat from the bottom and from the screen but it\'s not alarmingly hot at all.I know this because all my co-workers HP laptops get hotter than my machine.*|*|* This laptop comes with 3 GB memory and its maximum memory capacity is 4 GB. I feel that this typeof machine should be allowed to expand the memory up to 8 BG. It is already fast but you know,I felt that HP skipped a design on this respect.*|*|* Paying a full price on this laptop is not for people on a budget like me, but I just happened tofind a good deal and for the price I paid,it\'s a steal.HP G70-460US is an efficient,fast,quiet,cool-headed machine and I highly recommend it.', 'id': 1, 'realTags': [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]}
