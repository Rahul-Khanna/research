very cool to me in terms of build and weight (about four pounds). But even that started to feel big and heavy so when this one came out-- at this price!!!-- I pre-purchased.*|*|* I have been tracking discussions here and on the notebook review forums, and have some immediate answers to various concerns:1. it\'s 3 pounds six ounces with the battery. Feels like carrying a book.2. the wireless is intel 1000 bgn and has held steady and been very fast since I first got the computer.3. there\'s only one memory stick (2G) so you can easily pop in a second (which I did, before I even booted up the computer, for a grand total of $35.00) to bring the total memory to 4G.4. The keyboard is full sized, or, if it\'s smaller, the difference is so minimal I can\'t tell. It does seem to me that some of the edge keys (delete, tab, function keys) are smaller.5. It\'s crazy fast. My Windows Experence Index is:Processor 4.1Ram (with 4G) 4.8Graphics 3.5 (I\'m not bothered, but I\'m not a gamer)Gaming Graphics 3.3HDD 5.86. Touchpad does pinch zoom and is very responsive.*|*|* Have not installed all my software yet, but three hours of removing bloatware with the computer set on "high performance" and using WiFi leaves me with close to three hours of battery left.It\'s incredibly cool, meaning, in this case, temperature.In sum: I am in awe.*|*|* UDPATE: I have been using the laptop continually since my purchase. It continues to impress me with build quality and performance. I have been upgrading all our home computers to Windows 7, and I notice that the Intel card on this laptop finds the network more quickly than the gigabit ethernet card on my quad core desktop, and transfer speeds are as good as or better than the other wireless N cards in the house. So I think the people who have had trouble with the card may have gotten a bad card.*|*|* (Small comfort, I know...)I had some minor issues with the touchpad, which felt sticky and slow to me. I finally spent some time in the synaptics settings panel, changing the sensitivity and speed of the pointer, and now find it works very well for me. So if the touchpad is bothering you, give that a try.*|*|* I really like the keyboard-- my Dell xps m1330 often inserts an extra letter if I hit a key too hard, or, at the other end of the spectrum, misses a key. Never happens with this one.*|*|* More than one person, on seeing the computer, has thought I finally upgraded to Mac.*|*|* Note: Did a clean install of windows 7 from a usb drive, no problems, to get rid of bloatware.

I did not want thin and light - this machine would rarely leave the house and I would just get a desktop except that, these days, it's nice to be able to move the PC from desk to couch to bed to kitchen for use as a TV, as a phone, as a photo album, as toddler entertainment...The HP was on sale and provided the absolute max amount of screen for the dollar, and that was the deciding factor for me.*|*|*  Unlike a few years ago, most current laptops now have tremendous similarity in design and subcontractor components, so they all have decent keyboard, memory, hard drive, webcam, etc.  But the screen on the HP was enormous compared to others at this price point and the casing had a nice texture.I am very, very happy with this machine.

perfectly!--------------------------------------*|*|* After a week of ownership I'll say this device does exactly what was expected and at a reasonable speed.  Hard drive could be a little faster during bootup, but is responsive during general use.  Given the tiny keyboard, don't expect this to be a laptop replacement.. rather a very portable computer for those not requiring lots of data entry.I planned to use mine for couchtop browsing, light email, portable media entertainment, and to perform mobile wireless surveys for my occupation.*|*|*  By many accounts the previous gen Q1's and OQO's A110 cpu is underpowered, so I chose the Q1UP with a Core Solo processor.PROs: ---Processor is well matched to the machine (no speed demon but not slow either).  Programs start quickly, DVD rips play without stutter.*|*|* Beautiful and bright screen, web pages fit nicely width-wise and buttons make scrolling easy.  Small fonts are extremely clear and readable (though some may have trouble with this).  DVD rips and photos look great. (A remote would be nice!)  Passive digitizer works well, and unlike my other tablet's active screen I love being able to use my fingers, reducing stylus usage somewhat.  Haven't really done any inking so can't comment on palm-on-the-screen issues.*|*|*  You can play Solitaire with a finger!With it's PSP-like shape it looks like it will be fun to play games.  Mouse can be switched to joystick mode with a button press.  Don't load Oblivion though.. its not meant for high-end 3D games.*|*|* Rear camera quality (1.3mp) is surprisingly good, at least as viewed from the screen.  Front facing camera (0.3mp) is of decent quality and more than adequate for video chat.*|*|* Split-Qwerty thumb-keyboard:  fine for short entry like URLs, filenames and short emails.  Thank goodness this is the improved kb, as anything less would be quite difficult.  Button size is similar to that of my Treo 700.  I wasn't expecting to get much typing done this way but its so much better than always having to do tablet entry.  Included is a program called 'Dialkeys' which throws a larger thumb-board on the screen and is better for longer entries.. it does eat up some screen space.*|*|*  Being left-handed, I like the mouse on the left.*|*|* Battery life seems good given this model comes with the extended battery.  Watched a 2 hour DVD rip with screen on full brightness and still had 3+ hours of regular usage left.  Rated life is 7.5 hours.*|*|* Comes with a USB cable for transferring files between computers.  Plug both ends in and Voila', a file-manager-like program appears on both machines allowing easy transfer of files.  No software installation necessary, it just works.*|*|* CONs: ---None really, except for an annoying problem with my unit:  (Update: Unit replaced, problem gone!)When picking up or otherwise handling the unit, the 'Play Camera' program starts and takes a picture.  (Should only happen when touching the shutter button)  Subsequent handling causes many pictures to be taken and after 5 minutes I might have 50 pics that need to be deleted.  No use killing the program, as it will usually start up again.  The shutter button moves freely and isn't bound up, so I don't understand why the slight case flexing causes it to take a picture.  Oddly it doesn't always happen, but 75% of the time does.  I'm hoping its a defect with my particular unit as I plan to swap it for the same model.", 'realTags': [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'predictedTags': [], 'sentences': ['Edit 3 26 08 Five Stars Replacement unit is working perfectly', "After a week of ownership I'll say this device does exactly what was expected and at a reasonable speed", 'Hard drive could be a little faster during bootup but is responsive during general use', "Given the tiny keyboard don't expect this to be a laptop replacement rather a very portable computer for those not requiring lots of data entry", 'I planned to use mine for couchtop browsing light email portable media entertainment and to perform mobile wireless surveys for my occupation', "By many accounts the previous gen Q1's and OQO's A110 cpu is underpowered so I chose the Q1UP with a Core Solo processor", 'Processor is well matched to the machine no speed demon but not slow either ', 'Programs start quickly DVD rips play without stutter', 'Beautiful and bright screen web pages fit nicely width wise and buttons make scrolling easy', 'Small fonts are extremely clear and readable though some may have trouble with this ', 'DVD rips and photos look great', 'A remote would be nice', "Passive digitizer works well and unlike my other tablet's active screen I love being able to use my fingers reducing stylus usage somewhat", "Haven't really done any inking so can't comment on palm on the screen issues", "You can play Solitaire with a finger With it's PSP like shape it looks like it will be fun to play games", 'Mouse can be switched to joystick mode with a button press', "Don't load Oblivion though its not meant for high end 3D games", 'Rear camera quality 1', '3mp is surprisingly good at least as viewed from the screen', 'Front facing camera 0', '3mp is of decent quality and more than adequate for video chat', 'Split Qwerty thumb keyboard fine for short entry like URLs filenames and short emails', 'Thank goodness this is the improved kb as anything less would be quite difficult', 'Button size is similar to that of my Treo 700', "I wasn't expecting to get much typing done this way but its so much better than always having to do tablet entry", "Included is a program called 'Dialkeys' which throws a larger thumb board on the screen and is better for longer entries it does eat up some screen space", 'Being left handed I like the mouse on the left', 'Battery life seems good given this model comes with the extended battery', 'Watched a 2 hour DVD rip with screen on full brightness and still had 3 hours of regular usage left', 'Rated life is 7', '5 hours', 'Comes with a USB cable for transferring files between computers', "Plug both ends in and Voila' a file manager like program appears on both machines allowing easy transfer of files", 'No software installation necessary it just works', "CONs None really except for an annoying problem with my unit Update Unit replaced problem gone When picking up or otherwise handling the unit the 'Play Camera' program starts and takes a picture", 'Should only happen when touching the shutter button', 'Subsequent handling causes many pictures to be taken and after 5 minutes I might have 50 pics that need to be deleted', 'No use killing the program as it will usually start up again', "The shutter button moves freely and isn't bound up so I don't understand why the slight case flexing causes it to take a picture", "Oddly it doesn't always happen but 75 of the time does", "I'm hoping its a defect with my particular unit as I plan to swap it for the same model"], 'k': 18, 'predictedLDASentenceTags': [[6], [5], [17], [1], [4], [6], [9], [0], [5], [15], [14], [5], [8], [11], [12], [3], [14], [10], [10], [10], [11], [5], [7], [7], [6], [10], [9], [8], [9], [7], [9], [14], [6], [13], [10], [9], [9], [6], [10], [2], [1]]}

from Staples on Black Friday when they had it for $599, which I thought was a steal. I am very happy with the purchase.*|*|* The 17.3" screen is great and was a must-have for me. I have had a 17" laptop for a while and I wasn\'t going back! Obviously this makes it not quite as portable, but this sits at home most of the time and goes on trips with me. A 17" laptop is also a bit more difficult to find a carrying case for.*|*|* The fingerprint scanner was easy to set up and works very well every time I use it.Having a blu-ray drive as well as HDMI is fantastic, as I can use this as a blu-ray player at home.The speakers aren\'t quite as loud as I hoped, but they\'re certainly not quiet. I\'ve just heard a lot of talk about Beats Audio and was hoping for a little more volume. It\'s very clear at full volume with 0 static sound, so that\'s a plus.The keyboard is smooth and easy to type on and the mouse works well - as expected.*|*|* One thing I\'m not impressed with - multitouch. I have used a Mac multitouch mouse and they work very smoothly. This "multitouch" mouse is very spotty to the point of being almost useless. Do not consider the multitouch mouse a buying point - it rarely works properly. Even when it does work, the scrolling is entirely too fast to be useful.The overall design is very nice in my opinion.*|*|* I\'ve read a few places where people complain of the silver rim being cheap looking, and while it\'s not solid and unbreakable I think it looks good and won\'t be easy to break unless you drop the laptop or are very rough on it.*|*|* EDIT 9/9/2012: After some months of use, I was proven wrong. The plastic around the speakers on the front of the laptop do break. It\'s just a thin piece of plastic that broke off on both sides. Still, I\'m overall happy with the computer and would buy it again.*|*|* The HD webcam quality is OK. I don\'t think I\'d called it HD but probably a step under HD.The RAM is very easy to upgrade and the model I got had 1 4GB DDR3 stick with 1 empty slot - a cheaper upgrade than if it had 2 x 2GB sticks. There is a spot for a secondary hard drive, but I was disappointed to see that it did not include a cable to connect the 2nd hard drive to the laptop. This will have to be purchased separately, and I was able to find it online for $32 shipped.*|*|* This laptop runs very cool. Obviously I always take care not to impede airflow from the fan (don\'t put it on a soft blanket, bed, carpet, etc), but this is probably the coolest running laptop I\'ve ever owned.The 9-cell battery has excellent life, but does stick out the bottom of the laptop - about the only styling cue of this laptop that I don\'t like. It is somewhat functional, though - allowing for more airflow to cool the laptop.*|*|* Overall, a great buy and I\'m very happy with the purchase. It\'s a speedy, sharp-looking laptop which I suspect will give me years of computing.', 'realTags': [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], 'predictedTags': [], 'sentences': ['I bought this laptop from Staples on Black Friday when they had it for 599 which I thought was a steal', 'I am very happy with the purchase', 'The 17', '3 screen is great and was a must have for me', "I have had a 17 laptop for a while and I wasn't going back", 'Obviously this makes it not quite as portable but this sits at home most of the time and goes on trips with me', 'A 17 laptop is also a bit more difficult to find a carrying case for', 'The fingerprint scanner was easy to set up and works very well every time I use it', 'Having a blu ray drive as well as HDMI is fantastic as I can use this as a blu ray player at home', "The speakers aren't quite as loud as I hoped but they're certainly not quiet", "I've just heard a lot of talk about Beats Audio and was hoping for a little more volume", "It's very clear at full volume with 0 static sound so that's a plus", 'The keyboard is smooth and easy to type on and the mouse works well as expected', "One thing I'm not impressed with multitouch", 'I have used a Mac multitouch mouse and they work very smoothly', 'This multitouch mouse is very spotty to the point of being almost useless', 'Do not consider the multitouch mouse a buying point it rarely works properly', 'Even when it does work the scrolling is entirely too fast to be useful', 'The overall design is very nice in my opinion', "I've read a few places where people complain of the silver rim being cheap looking and while it's not solid and unbreakable I think it looks good and won't be easy to break unless you drop the laptop or are very rough on it", 'EDIT 9 9 2012 After some months of use I was proven wrong', 'The plastic around the speakers on the front of the laptop do break', "It's just a thin piece of plastic that broke off on both sides", "Still I'm overall happy with the computer and would buy it again", 'The HD webcam quality is OK', " I don't think I'd called it HD but probably a step under HD", 'The RAM is very easy to upgrade and the model I got had 1 4GB DDR3 stick with 1 empty slot a cheaper upgrade than if it had 2 x 2GB sticks', 'There is a spot for a secondary hard drive but I was disappointed to see that it did not include a cable to connect the 2nd hard drive to the laptop', 'This will have to be purchased separately and I was able to find it online for 32 shipped', 'This laptop runs very cool', "Obviously I always take care not to impede airflow from the fan don't put it on a soft blanket bed carpet etc but this is probably the coolest running laptop I've ever owned", "The 9 cell battery has excellent life but does stick out the bottom of the laptop about the only styling cue of this laptop that I don't like", 'It is somewhat functional though allowing for more airflow to cool the laptop', "Overall a great buy and I'm very happy with the purchase", "It's a speedy sharp looking laptop which I suspect will give me years of computing"], 'k': 18, 'predictedLDASentenceTags': [[2], [8], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [7], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [6], [12], [7], [15], [14], [3], [3], [9], [6], [9], [9], [6], [17], [0], [9], [9], [5], [5], [7], [3], [10], [8], [6], [11], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [1], [9], [12], [7], [1]]}

years to chronicle my motorcycle trips.I was loathe to give up saddlebag space to a full-size laptop and worried that the heat, dust and vibration of motorcycle travel would kill a laptop with a conventional hard disk drive.So I started out with travel journals, but I had to wait until I got home to blog my trip stories.*|*|* Then, five years ago, I tried blogging from the road with a Palm Treo 300. It was barely adequate. I stepped up to a Treo 600, and then the 700p, but even with the accessory fold-out keyboards, it was still a chore to write blog entries and manage my e-mail. And while the cameras have improved, they\'re still pretty bad.I miss the 3G connectivity with the Mini 9, but Wifi hotspots are becoming more plentiful and it\'s getting easier to find them, especially if you have the AT&T; deal with Starbucks or McDonald\'s.*|*|* The SSD (solid state drive) seems perfect for motorcycle travel, since it has no moving parts and is, therefore, less vulnerable to damage from vibration.The 1GB of RAM and 8GB of SSD capacity are plenty, assuming you don\'t junk the Mini 9 up with lots of software. And there isn\'t any reason to do that, considering that you can do all of your email, word processing, spreadsheets, calendars, and other office-type functions up in "the cloud" with Google Apps.*|*|* I found the Internet Explorer browser\'s menu bars took up too much screen real estate, so I installed Google\'s streamlined Chrome browser that lets me see more of the web pages at a glance. I also avoid loading up the SSD by using an 8GB SanDisk thumb drive as a D: drive.*|*|* I\'m not much for touchpads - the Mini 9\'s touchpad works fine, I\'m just not a touchpad guy - so I use a wireless optical mouse.*|*|* The built-in webcam is surprisingly good. I have yet to use it for a live conversation, but it shoots quite acceptable still photos. The SD card reader is perfect for importing images from a higher-quality digital camera.*|*|* The smaller keyboard takes a little getting used to. The apostrophe and quote marks and dash/underscore are not where my fingers expected to find them, but it doesn\'t take long to make the synaptic adjustment.*|*|* The Mini 9 is intelligently designed when it comes to upgrades. You can access its guts by removing two screws and a cover plate on the underside. As I said, it comes with 1GB of RAM. You can double that for about $30 and the conversion takes about 5 minutes.*|*|* Computer development being what it is, there are sure to be subsequent generations of netbooks with more speed, power and versatility.
