After much review, and a try-out with an Acer 1410, I decided that I wanted a full-sized chiclet/island keyboard and the larger screen. I'm already quite pleased with my decision. At the &lt;$700 price point, this is an excellent notebook.*|*|* Pros- Keyboard. A pleasure to type on.- Touchpad. It drags at first, but once you get some finger oil on it, and change the pointer speed, it's one of the best that I've used. Very smooth two finger scroller. Support for customized two and three finger click.*|*|*- Screen. Bright and easy to read at 30 degree angles.*|*|*- Battery life. Yes, it will do over 10 hours.- Weight/size. 1 inch thin and very light.- Body. Love the brushed black metal look on the case.*|*|*- Asus facial recognition login. Didn't think that I would care, but it's nice to have the computer log in, without touch, when I'm sitting in front of it.- Asus FastBoot (not the BIOS fast boot). This lets you configure which programs load during startup and which load after. Speeds up the boot quite a bit.*|*|*- Decent speakers. Not ear-destroying, but suitable for the size.

It is evident that speed was a big priority in the making of this device.*|*|* The computer itself is quite aesthetically pleasing; I have gotten asked about it already in the few short days I have had it. It feels solidly built, and is very comfortable to hold and use. I love the keyboard, it feels good to type on. The track pad is great as well. It is large, and has a clickable button built in that is neat to use. From what I can see, the computer doesn't seem too fragile, and there isn't anything hanging off that can get snagged.*|*|* As for the Operating System: Chrome OS is great, if you know what it is all about. This computer is not for the person who is set in their ways of having certain programs they use every day, such as iTunes, Photoshop, MS Office. You can not install these programs on the Chromebook. That being said, there are many applications that can take place of these programs. Google Docs is a stripped down MS Office that has the same basic functionality. There are several music apps that would be happy to let you store your music library on them. Google is constantly updating the software and bringing more functionality to Chrome OS as well.*|*|* No frills, no viruses to get, minimal set-up, instant start up and shut down, and great hardware is a great experience.

aging laptop at home, where the extent of our mobility requirement is that we occasionally move it from room to room.  (If we simply wanted a computer for a fixed location, we probably would have purchased a desktop model for somewhat less money and/or better performance.)*|*|*  Beyond normal uses such as spreadsheets and publishing programs, the 2.2 GHz Intel Core Duo 2 T6600 processor is plenty powerful enough for typical household needs, including photography work and most games.  If you are a serious gamer, however, you will want more processing power and a discrete graphics card, which this laptop doesn\'t have.*|*|*  Unlike most netbooks or "ultra-thin" laptops (which slot between netbooks and traditional laptops), this unit comes with 4GB of memory, which should remain sufficient for several years, and a solid 400GB hard drive.  That, along with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, should last you years.*|*|* The large (16 inch) display is bright, crisp and a joy to behold.  I\'ve read some complaints about the keyboard, but we like it.  There is a numeric keypad, which really saves time if you frequently work with numbers.  The touchpad is not located in the middle of the unit, which troubles some people (although it is easy to get used to).  If you look carefully at an image of the keyboard, you will see that the touchpad is located roughly in the middle of what I would call the traditional keyboard area (from the left shift key to the right shift key), which is where you will normally find your hands when typing.  The two internal speakers are simply great for a laptop, but don\'t expect miracles from 1.5 inch speakers.  The "fusion" finish looks sharp, but it attracts fingerprints like honey attracts bees.*|*|* This Toshiba comes with a six-cell battery and an advertised 3 hours and 20 minute battery life, although we got closer to 2 hours and 30 minutes of battery use with normal settings.  Regardless, we don\'t run this on battery power that often, and if what you want is really long battery life, you should look at a netbook or ultra-thin.*|*|* The Windows 7 software is 64-bit, which is where personal computing is headed, so that\'s an advantage.  However, you may find some compatibility problems with older software or hardware such as printers (many printer manufacturers will have compatible drivers available shortly).*|*|* Before you rule this laptop in for your situation, however, you should first rule out various alternatives.  If mobility is a key concern for you, this isn\'t the right choice.  Yes, you can pick it up and carry it around, but at 15 inches in width and over seven pounds, I wouldn\'t want to lug it around for long.  For, say, a college student who wants to take notes in class every day (and who can accept the limited processing power of less capable machines), a smaller, lighter computer with much better battery life is a better choice.  Get a netbook, or maybe an ultra-thin.*|*|*  If you are a serious gamer or video editor, then you need a high-end machine with a discrete graphics card and a more powerful processor.  Just be prepared to pay up for it.*|*|*  And if you have no mobility requirement, consider a desktop.*|*|* However, if what you want is a desktop replacement laptop with plenty of memory, good processing power, speed, a large screen, a roomy hard drive, lots of ports, etc., then this laptop features an attractive combination of these features in a relatively economical package.

Finally decided on this Samsung Series 3 NP350U2A-A01US 12.5-Inch Laptop with i3 Intel processor.  Would have preferred the i5 processor that was featured in all the CNET reviews I looked at, but even with the i3 this is still a steal.*|*|* The design is sleek and professional.  The keyboard is true to size and is very easy to use.  Even the touchpad does not slow me down.  Other reviews (both on Amazon and on CNET) said had a little lag between using touchpad and keyboard, but I have not had any issues.*|*|* The best part is the weight and the battery life.  The extra 4 hours in battery life is SOOOOO worth the extra money over the Samsung Series 3 NP300 earlier model that is still offered on Amazon.*|*|*  There is little to no heat from the laptop because the vent is facing to the rear and not located in the base like a lot of other laptop models.*|*|* The weight is around 3lbs.  This means it is small like a tablet and I can slip it into my purse but it still has the full functionality of a larger laptop.*|*|*  My main use for this is to run PowerPoint presentations... can\'t really do that efficiently with tablets or netbooks because they just don\'t have the processing ability.  So if you need a solid PC for personal use, but still like to have something that you can carry around easily... this is definitely the one to pick!*|*|* HELPFUL HINTS --- The product description does not indicate that the laptop comes with a VGA adaptar as part of the included peripherals.  So, don\'t buy a VGA adaptar, you get one in the box with the computer already.*|*|* Also, if you are looking for a laptop sleeve to protect your new baby... all sleeves that fit the 13"Mac Air will also fit this laptop.*|*|* Bottom line... this is a great machine with a lot of power for the price.

this computer had no reviews and I love this machine.*|*|* One thing about the marketing page though. Amazon has it advertised as 1 TB 7200 Hard drive. Instead, it has 2 Western Digital 500 GB 7200 RPM drives which are very easy to access in terms of opening up the laptop and messing with hardware. I have not changed any hardware and do not intend to.*|*|* The screen is fantastic, the 1920x1080 res just makes everything look beautiful. The 17.3 inches is a little big but it's easy enough to carry around.*|*|* This laptop is not advertised as a gaming laptop but every game I have tried so far, Assassins Creed Franchise, Half Life 2, Team Fortress 2, and Sid Meier's Civilization 5, run perfectly with no lag even when running at full graphics. Today, I have spent almost 4 hours gaming without turning off or taking a break and the laptop external surface temp is room temperature if not a tad bit cooler.*|*|* The included subwoofer is a nice addition which virtually takes out all of the tinny sounds that laptops are almost infamous for. When I have blasted the speakers at their full capacity I was able to hear this laptop almost 75 ft away with no issues.*|*|* The computer does come with a decent amount of pre-installed software but nothing that can't be uninstalled via the control panel. Also, the side button on the side that can be programmed is very nice. Also, the case is classy and sophisticated. The brushed aluminium design makes the computer look sleek and professional.*|*|* I only have two complaints with it so far.1. The track pad. It looks nice and the concept with multi-gesture support is interesting, but it doesn't work. I don't like it. The pad is flimsy and a little over sized and the clicking is temperamental. However, this doesn't bother me too much because I use an external Logitech G500 mouse and I have disabled the track pad.2. The keyboard tends to stick when you press keys too hard but its barely noticeable when typing.*|*|* Overall, amazing laptop and I am very pleased with my purchase. If you are looking at the Asus N56VZ-DS71, the hardware is virtually the same, except for the hard drives and resolution size. I went with this one because the N56 has a 5400 rpm drive which causes severe bottleneck issues in terms of power.*|*|* On a side note, I was able to transfer roughly 50 GB of music from an external hard drive to this computer in under 10 minutes. I'm happy I spent the extra 100 dollars on this faster laptop, though I wish it was offered in the 16.3 inch size.*|*|* If you want to see an in depth video review, look up xoticpc Asus N76VZ-DS71 on youtube. They have a really nice 25 minute video review.*|*|* I chose to buy from amazon because at the time it was the better deal. Love the Asus name and this laptop.*|*|* UPDATEJust a couple things I have found after using this laptop for several months. It has an internal high quality microphone which I didn't realize at the time and that Amazon did not advertise.Also, I was mistaken, the hard drives are not western digital, they are seagate.When you buy this laptop, the two hard drives are partitioned into 4 hard drives each containing roughly 256 gb. This is one thing I do not like and I didn't realize it until after I bought it and installed all of my software on.

4810TZ-4508 to replace my two-year old Lenovo Thinkpad T61, and I love it!*|*|* Getting started was very easy.  It only took me about two hours to register Windows 7 Home Premium, upgrade to Windows 7 Professional (through the Anytime Upgrade feature), create factory default backup discs, remove some bloatware, and install some of my favorite programs.  After reading some of the reviews of the older models, I was worried about the prospect of flashing the BIOS or updating the VGA/LAN drivers, but my computer has worked fine without those updates.  I suspect that Acer may have fixed those problems for this model, since it's a new release with Windows 7.*|*|* Although the processor is ostensibly slower than the Intel Core 2 Duo processor in my T61, I had to underclock the T61 because it tended to overheat and shut down.  With this Timeline, I'm able to run the processor at full speed without any heating or cooling problems.  The computer is surprisingly zippy.  I found that I was able to listen to music, convert tracks on iTunes, surf the web, and install programs all at the same time, without any noticeable lag in performance.  Full screen streaming video on [...] and [...] also looked fantastic, without any jerkiness or skipping.  (In fact, video playback was better than on my Thinkpad which, notwitstanding the faster processor, had less RAM and a slower video card.)*|*|*  The screen is very bright, and even at the dimmest setting, I was surprised with how much clearer it was than my old Thinkpad.  It is a glossy screen, however, which means that it looks great indoors but is very difficult to use outdoors.  I have found the glare a bit distracting, but not a deal-breaker.  I don't play computer games, so I can't say anything about its performance in that regard.*|*|* Of course, one of the main reasons I purchased the Timeline was for portability, and it really doesn't disappoint.  The laptop is noticeably thinner and lighter than my T61 - I think the total weight is about 4 lbs. and it's just over an inch thick.*|*|*  Acer wasn't kidding about the battery life:  I spent 4.5 hours today at Starbucks surfing the web, listening to music, and using Microsoft Word with the screen at medium brightness, and still had 45% battery by the end.  I am sure that I could get about 8-9 hours of total battery life, if I minimized all the settings.  After fighting for power outlets and worrying about tripping over power cords with my Thinkpad, this is a refreshing change.*|*|* Coming from using the T61's fantastic keyboard, I was kind of nervous about this chiclet-style design, but I easily got used to it.

'review': 'I purchased this laptop as a desktop replacement and I use it for gaming, watching movies, writing software, and basic Microsoft Office and web browsing tasks.  Overall I am extremely pleased with it and would highly recommend it to others.  Here\'s the breakdown:*|*|*PROS:- This is an extremely fast machine.  It boots up in under a minute with Windows 7 and I have yet to notice the occasional lag with starting up programs that I experience with most Windows PC\'s.- Newer games like "Dragon Age: Origins" run extremely well on this machine with all of the graphics maxed out-*|*|* The screen on this computer is beautiful.  The color quality and contrast are extremely good and there is a ton of screen real estate.  Some people have complained that it isn\'t full 1080p but I find that the 1680x945 resolution makes icons and text the perfect size for this size of screen.*|*|*- Multitasking works great with a dual-core processor (four virtual cores with hyperthreading) and 4GB of DDR3 RAM.  I routinely have 12 Firefox tabs up while watching videos in iTunes and editing four or five MS Office documents. A lot of computers don\'t like this but the Q860 handles it wonderfully.*|*|*- The battery life is over three hours, which is pretty good for such a behemoth.*|*|* CONS:- This is an extremely heavy laptop and I wouldn\'t recommend it for frequent business travel.  That being said, I do use this laptop for grad school and haul it back and forth to class one day a week using a Toshiba 18" gaming backpack and it isn\'t terrible on my back.  I would definitely recommend a backpack if you want to carry this thing around as a normal laptop shoulder bag would probably destroy your neck and shoulder.*|*|*- Both Toshiba and Amazon claim on their websites that this keyboard is backlit but unfortunately, it isn\'t.  Amazon customer service handled this issue extremely well after I reported it, so I can\'t complain about this too much.  All X505-series keyboards are compatible so you can probably pick up a backlit one off of eBay if that\'s a big deal to you.*|*|*- There is a decent amount of junkware pre-installed on this system, although not nearly as much as on the last Dell computer I bought.  It\'s kind of annoying that Toshiba does this on a high-performance computer that will probably be purchased by people that don\'t want or need it.*|*|* OVERALL:- I did a large amount of research before buying this laptop and as of this moment, there isn\'t a better value out there in gaming laptops than this.  It lacks some of the higher-end features such as dual graphics cards, a 1080p display, and solid-state drives, but for the money you can\'t do better than this.  I am now selling both of my desktops and I plan on making this my sole computer.', 'realTags': [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], 'predictedTags': [], 'sentences': ['I purchased this laptop as a desktop replacement and I use it for gaming watching movies writing software and basic Microsoft Office and web browsing tasks', 'Overall I am extremely pleased with it and would highly recommend it to others', "Here's the breakdown", 'PROS This is an extremely fast machine', "It boots up in under a minute with Windows 7 and I have yet to notice the occasional lag with starting up programs that I experience with most Windows PC's", ' Newer games like Dragon Age Origins run extremely well on this machine with all of the graphics maxed out', 'The screen on this computer is beautiful', 'The color quality and contrast are extremely good and there is a ton of screen real estate', "Some people have complained that it isn't full 1080p but I find that the 1680x945 resolution makes icons and text the perfect size for this size of screen", 'Multitasking works great with a dual core processor four virtual cores with hyperthreading and 4GB of DDR3 RAM', ' I routinely have 12 Firefox tabs up while watching videos in iTunes and editing four or five MS Office documents', "A lot of computers don't like this but the Q860 handles it wonderfully", 'The battery life is over three hours which is pretty good for such a behemoth', "CONS This is an extremely heavy laptop and I wouldn't recommend it for frequent business travel", "That being said I do use this laptop for grad school and haul it back and forth to class one day a week using a Toshiba 18 gaming backpack and it isn't terrible on my back", 'I would definitely recommend a backpack if you want to carry this thing around as a normal laptop shoulder bag would probably destroy your neck and shoulder', "Both Toshiba and Amazon claim on their websites that this keyboard is backlit but unfortunately it isn't", "Amazon customer service handled this issue extremely well after I reported it so I can't complain about this too much", "All X505 series keyboards are compatible so you can probably pick up a backlit one off of eBay if that's a big deal to you", 'There is a decent amount of junkware pre installed on this system although not nearly as much as on the last Dell computer I bought', "It's kind of annoying that Toshiba does this on a high performance computer that will probably be purchased by people that don't want or need it", "OVERALL I did a large amount of research before buying this laptop and as of this moment there isn't a better value out there in gaming laptops than this", "It lacks some of the higher end features such as dual graphics cards a 1080p display and solid state drives but for the money you can't do better than this", 'I am now selling both of my desktops and I plan on making this my sole computer'], 'k': 18, 'predictedLDASentenceTags': [[1], [16], [17], [6], [4], [4], [10], [3], [8], [14], [1], [14], [5], [7], [8], [8], [1], [8], [0], [4], [9], [16], [8], [1]]}

worth mentioning that my HP dv6000 gave me 2 years of pain since the very first 3 months, so, after the HP did not want to turn on I was on an emergency situation. I also want to mention that I have had VAIO, Compaq and ASUS between my wife and I.Normally I sell them used, in very good condition -excepting the last HP... I consider these brands very good, but for the sake of evaluating this device I might compare them with the performance of the other brands.*|*|* For reference I paid more than $1200 for the less expensive of the brands mentioned above, and less than $550 for this one.*|*|* What I like about this ACER Aspire:1.- The computer has a full size keyboard, so that is a good start.2.- It does not come with lots of bundled software (normally I delete most of it anyway)3.- It boots fairly quickly, compare to HP and VAIO more expensive laptops.4.- The screen is clear, fairly bright, not reflective, and, to my preference, it has a 150 or so angle of view.5.- It is fairly light weight, (actually lighter than a 14 inch HP or VAIO)6.- It does not get hot at all, and those of you who have tried the HPs know what it feels to burn the fingers while using the mouse.7.- The fan is low, actually so far I have not heard it yet. Now, although I keep it turned on for most of the day and part of the night, I normally don\'t place it over soft surfaces like beds or couches, since that covers the vents.8.- For those of you who know about the Windows Experience Index, it scores 4.0, what is fairly fast for the price.9.- The webcam is really sensitive to low light conditions, so you can chat with the lights off in your room and illuminate yourself with the light of the screen. Microphone is good.10.- Speakers are loud, forget about HP or VAIO or ASUS low volume ones*|*|* What I dislike (but still acknowledge that I paid less than $550):1.- Keyboard feels less solid than Vaio or Asus2.- Battery life is around 2 - 2:30 hours3.- Does not have bluetooth (I bought a little IOGear Bluetooth 2.0 USB Micro Adapter)4.- Honestly I don\'t have any other dislikes so far...*|*|* So bottom line, I am very impressed with this laptop, and although hesitant at the beginning for the price "too good to be truth", I would definitely recommend this computer to anyone; it is fast, lots of memory, good ram and great video experience.', 'realTags': [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], 'predictedTags': [], 'sentences': ['I bought this laptop about a month ago April 2009 and so far it has been a great computer', 'This is my first ACER I think it is worth mentioning that my HP dv6000 gave me 2 years of pain since the very first 3 months so after the HP did not want to turn on I was on an emergency situation', 'I also want to mention that I have had VAIO Compaq and ASUS between my wife and I', 'Normally I sell them used in very good condition excepting the last HP I consider these brands very good but for the sake of evaluating this device I might compare them with the performance of the other brands', 'For reference I paid more than 1200 for the less expensive of the brands mentioned above and less than 550 for this one', 'What I like about this ACER Aspire 1', 'The computer has a full size keyboard so that is a good start.2', ' It does not come with lots of bundled software normally I delete most of it anyway 3', 'It boots fairly quickly compare to HP and VAIO more expensive laptops.4', 'The screen is clear fairly bright not reflective and to my preference it has a 150 or so angle of view.5', ' It is fairly light weight actually lighter than a 14 inch HP or VAIO 6', ' It does not get hot at all and those of you who have tried the HPs know what it feels to burn the fingers while using the mouse.7', ' The fan is low actually so far I have not heard it yet', "Now although I keep it turned on for most of the day and part of the night I normally don't place it over soft surfaces like beds or couches since that covers the vents.8", 'For those of you who know about the Windows Experience Index it scores 4', '0 what is fairly fast for the price.9', 'The webcam is really sensitive to low light conditions so you can chat with the lights off in your room and illuminate yourself with the light of the screen', 'Microphone is good.10', ' Speakers are loud forget about HP or VAIO or ASUS low volume ones', 'What I dislike but still acknowledge that I paid less than 550 1', ' Keyboard feels less solid than Vaio or Asus2', ' Battery life is around 2 2 30 hours3', ' Does not have bluetooth I bought a little IOGear Bluetooth 2', '0 USB Micro Adapter 4', " Honestly I don't have any other dislikes so far", 'So bottom line I am very impressed with this laptop and although hesitant at the beginning for the price too good to be truth I would definitely recommend this computer to anyone it is fast lots of memory good ram and great video experience'], 'k': 18, 'predictedLDASentenceTags': [[6], [9], [14], [3], [3], [15], [5], [13], [3], [11], [5], [9], [17], [5], [4], [4], [11], [5], [14], [10], [2], [8], [13], [1], [3], [7]]}

Arrived late due to FedEx, not the fault of Amazon, Warehouse Sur+ or Acer, of course. It was double boxed for shipping, arrived in excellent condition.*|*|* Excellent finish which makes smudges hard to see. Screen is nice and big, crystal clear. We have 4 Acer monitors and all work very well. Not a single issue with them and two are several years old, so we were pretty sure Acer would make a good laptop as well.*|*|* The laptop comes with Windows 7 Home Premium but no DVD for it so you can't reinstall easily. The key code for it is on a sticker on the bottom of the laptop, so if you get an OEM Windows 7 DVD that key should work to reinstall Windows 7.*|*|* It also comes with some craplets, but you might be interested in McAfee's antivirus (we weren't, we use Microsofts Security Essentials, free download from MS with an authenticated Windows system).We reformatted the hard drive into multiple partitions and installed Windows 7 64bit Ultimate (we use BitLocker drive data encryption for data on the laptop and on the USB drives).*|*|* The reformat and reinstall worked just fine (and no craplets!). Since there is no disk with the system, there were a lot of missing drivers (for the network card, wireless device, several Intel drivers, the camera, etc). All were easy to find at the Acer web site (get them beforehand, unless you have another computer to download with).Once we added the network driver, we could instantly see the local network computers and printers, and internet. Once that was found, we went to Microsoft Updates and that seemed to find most the other drivers for updating, including the video card drivers. The Acer website for the AS5742Z lists drivers for both AMD video cards and nVidia, although you probably don't want or need both, and they are large files. The Microsoft Update website detected and installed the appropriate video driver, which makes life a lot easier.*|*|* If you decide you want to install Windows XP (we tried just to check if it works) it does run fine, although we did have to go into the BIOS at bootup and change the SATA setting to IDE. The default value crashes XP during installation. That's a minor issue, since Windows 7 is so much better anyway. If you use the normal 32 bit XP, you won't use all of the 4GB of ram; you need the 64 bit operating systems to do that, which is why Acer provides the Windows 7 64 bit version.*|*|* The laptop has 3 USB ports, two on the right side, one on the left. We put USB thumbnail drives into them all to test them and had no issues. We tried the wireless network, it was fine. We also connected to our 10/100/1000 wired network, and the laptop transferred a large file at the full 1Gbps speed.

(PC3-12800) notebook modules, CT102464BF160B. The computer immediately recognized the new memory, doubling the OEM 8GB installation to 16 GB. While the captive screws that hold the memory cover in are a puzzling choice by Dell, it the addition of a some inexpensive RAM increased the overall capability of this machine.*|*|*\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94This laptop lives a crowded part of the laptop market vying for your attention (and your next major technology purchase budget!).While I can\'t yet address its long term performance and reliability, the initial performance of this laptop has been flawless in all of the  typical tasks I ask of my notebook computers: office productivity applications, digital image manipulation, light video rendering/editing , online activities and music library management. I\'m not a gamer, so can\'t address this aspect of its capability.*|*|* After unboxing, expect to invest some time in initial set-up and preparation before you can start using and customizing your laptop.  My unit required about 40 Windows 8 updates. After accepting and installing these, I moved forward with the Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 update, available at no cost via the "Store" icon on the Metro interface. Be prepared: it\'s a large download (over 3 GB), although you can keep working until the very end of the update, which includes several computer restarts. All of these updates were completely error-free. It took about 90 minutes total for the download and Windows 8.1 upgrade.*|*|* This computer ships without installation discs or recovery media. A Dell OEM program will prompt you to create your own using either the optical drive (for writing to DVD) or a USB port (for writing to a USB drive). You\'ll need to have at least 12 GB available. Out of an abundance of caution, I created one set of each. Writing to a USB solid state device took about 35 minutes. Optical disk writing required four DVDs and took about 100 minutes. In the event you need to restore the computer, the recovery media returns it to a Windows 8 state. Note: Although Dell will sell you an option to restore directly to a Windows 8.1 installation, I can work with restoration to Windows 8.*|*|* Pros:-abundant connection options for data transfer tasks (optical drive, four USB ports, ethernet port, SSD slot, integrated WiFi and Bluetooth).*|*|* -touch screen allowing full exercise of Windows 8 and 8.1 functions. This is the first computer I\'ve used with such a capability. While I\'m still assessing the user experience, it is improving my interaction with Windows 8.*|*|* -Brushed metal case and wrist-rest surface reduces fingerprint visibility.-Battery life: about six hours when fully charged (depending on what you\'re asking it to do)-Display size-RAM: ships with 8 GB, which is generous. This laptop is upgradable to 16 GB (using two 8 GBmodules)*|*|* Cons (these are minor, but you should be aware):-Already discussed above: no included back-up media. You get to roll your own.-The four indicator lights (for power on disk activity, AC connectivity and and WiFi on/off are located on the forward vertical edge of the case.

I wanted an inexpensive 11.6 inch notebook with Windows 7 to travel with and use in and around my home.  I found it with the Acer V5-131-2629.*|*|* When I discovered this Windows 7 laptop, I was excited to find that it was still available in mass quantities.  In fact, mine was manufactured only a couple of months ago.  I really didn\'t want to go the Windows 8 route for what I was trying to accomplish with this laptop.*|*|* This laptop had everything I was looking for; Windows 7 Home Premium, Intel Celeron 1007U 1.5 GHz dual core processor, 11.6" screen (1366x768), 4GB DDR3 ram memory, 500GB hard drive, Intel GMA HD Graphics, WIFI A, G, N and Bluetooth 4.0.  It also has three USB ports (2.0) and not 3.0 as advertised along with HDMI, VGA and Ethernet ports.*|*|*  It also comes with a 6-cell lithium ion battery with a battery life of 6.5 hours.  The battery does protrude at the bottom of the laptop, but in turn gives it a nice angle to use.  You can order a four cell battery replacement if you want a slimmer and flush look to the laptop at the expense of battery life.  I ordered one and will use the 6-cell battery as a spare.*|*|* The laptop itself has a great design and form factor.  If you have seen Acer\'s Chromebook C710 11.6" laptop, this is the same exact laptop, but in black and the inclusion of Windows 7. The chiclet keyboard and screen are very good.  It is very easy to open the back panel for any user upgrades such as upgrading the ram or hard drive to an SSD.  All you have to do is remove one screw and slide the back panel off.*|*|* After using this laptop, I\'m very pleased with it.  The Windows Experience Index rates it 4.4 out of the box with no upgrades. It is very fast and has no problems streaming 1080p video.  I have noticed no lag at all.*|*|* If you want the flexibility of a laptop without the limitations of a tablet, this Acer laptop offers lots of bang and a real good look for the buck.  I strongly recommend it.I have a video of the laptop hands on.

Aspire One 722 may be small in size and price, but don't let that fool you. With it's 500GB hard drive and 4G memory it's larger than any desktops we own, and faster too.Though I haven't had the Acer long, it is continually impressive.*|*|*  Out of the box, I was pleased to see it lacking in much of the bloatware that came on my HP netbook and Gateway laptop.  The desktop was blissfully vacant, leaving me to populate it with my own selections of programs.*|*|* Connecting to any WiFi has been a matter of a couple of clicks, including our sometimes difficult home wifi that treats new devices with deep suspicion.  The Acer was accepted onto our home network with no issues at all.*|*|* Whether loading on photos from sd, using the built-in webcam, or utilizing 3rd party readers such as Kindle for PC and Overdrive Media Console, everything works seamlessly.*|*|* I've read some reviews recently that laptops can run annoyingly hot, but that is not the case with the Acer.  It's quiet and cool, even when streaming videos.  If you are a person who, like me, is easily bothered by excessive electronic noise, you will especially appreciate this quiet little Acer.*|*|* A early drawback was the whiteness of the background.  Even after turning the brightness all the way down, the whiteness was too intense.  Fortunately, it is completely adjustable in the Control Panal where you can customize themes, colors etc. I was able to choose a background with a gentle glow much like the color on my favorite e-readers.*|*|* For many, the multi-gesture function is a good selling point and many will enjoy it. I, however, could not get accustomed to it and was happy to discover I could disable the features one by one until it functioned perfectly for me.*|*|* Certainly, this is not a high end laptop and it shows in the plastic and hinges, we well as the plug for the ac adapter.  I'm gentle plugging it in because the connection feels a little frail.  Same with transporting it. The shell is light plastic so I am extra careful.*|*|* But for such an outstanding low price it's worth it.  I only paid 250.00 for mine with a rebate, but it is a good value even at a higher price.*|*|* If you plan to listen to music or videos without headphones you'll want a good external speaker, but this is true for many laptops.  I used my Jawbone Jambox speaker and it sounded great. I don't think this Acer model has bluetooth, so I used a cord into the audio.*|*|* Comes with Windows 7.  Finally, Microsoft has produced an operating system I like almost as much as XP. It even has a built in security suite from Microsoft.And lastly, there are amazing desktop background photos including landscapes and screens from around the world that automatically rotate through the day.  I never know what dynamic desktop scene I will treated to next. It's an unexpected pleasure.*|*|* The Acer Aspire One is an excellent choice for the budget-minded person who also wants some speed and storage space.  I'm so impressed, I would consider Acer in the future for my higher end electronics.", 'realTags': [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], 'predictedTags': [], 'sentences': ["The Acer Aspire One 722 may be small in size and price but don't let that fool you", "With it's 500GB hard drive and 4G memory it's larger than any desktops we own and faster too", "Though I haven't had the Acer long it is continually impressive", 'Out of the box I was pleased to see it lacking in much of the bloatware that came on my HP netbook and Gateway laptop', 'The desktop was blissfully vacant leaving me to populate it with my own selections of programs', 'Connecting to any WiFi has been a matter of a couple of clicks including our sometimes difficult home wifi that treats new devices with deep suspicion', 'The Acer was accepted onto our home network with no issues at all', 'Whether loading on photos from sd using the built in webcam or utilizing 3rd party readers such as Kindle for PC and Overdrive Media Console everything works seamlessly', "I've read some reviews recently that laptops can run annoyingly hot but that is not the case with the Acer", "It's quiet and cool even when streaming videos", 'If you are a person who like me is easily bothered by excessive electronic noise you will especially appreciate this quiet little Acer', 'A early drawback was the whiteness of the background', 'Even after turning the brightness all the way down the whiteness was too intense', 'Fortunately it is completely adjustable in the Control Panal where you can customize themes colors etc', 'I was able to choose a background with a gentle glow much like the color on my favorite e readers', 'For many the multi gesture function is a good selling point and many will enjoy it', 'I however could not get accustomed to it and was happy to discover I could disable the features one by one until it functioned perfectly for me', 'Certainly this is not a high end laptop and it shows in the plastic and hinges we well as the plug for the ac adapter', "I'm gentle plugging it in because the connection feels a little frail", 'Same with transporting it', 'The shell is light plastic so I am extra careful', "But for such an outstanding low price it's worth it", 'I only paid 250', '00 for mine with a rebate but it is a good value even at a higher price', "If you plan to listen to music or videos without headphones you'll want a good external speaker but this is true for many laptops", 'I used my Jawbone Jambox speaker and it sounded great', "I don't think this Acer model has bluetooth so I used a cord into the audio", 'Comes with Windows 7', 'Finally Microsoft has produced an operating system I like almost as much as XP', ' It even has a built in security suite from Microsoft', 'And lastly there are amazing desktop background photos including landscapes and screens from around the world that automatically rotate through the day', 'I never know what dynamic desktop scene I will treated to next', "It's an unexpected pleasure", 'The Acer Aspire One is an excellent choice for the budget minded person who also wants some speed and storage space', "I'm so impressed I would consider Acer in the future for my higher end electronics"], 'k': 18, 'predictedLDASentenceTags': [[0], [1], [17], [16], [5], [2], [11], [7], [14], [16], [8], [13], [3], [8], [4], [10], [12], [10], [6], [13], [5], [12], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [4], [16], [16], [3], [4], [9], [7], [1], [5], [5], [3], [4]]}

Which one? Will it be powerful enough? Big enough...?Maybe a Sony Vaio would be better?I'm a Windows software developer but I'm going back to school for my MBA and I wanted a smaller, simple notebook for papers and internet communication for classwork. It needs to be durable and I need it to work without a lot of fussing around with system bits.After much research I chose the MacBook over the pro because of the smaller size and the fact that the aluminum on the pro although cool, can dent easily.*|*|* The matte black finish on the MacBook is elegant, tough, and the build quality it top notch. Does the the black eventually get smears on it from your hands and fingers? Yes it does but just wipe them off every so often. It's not a big deal.*|*|* IMO, aside from a few points in processor speed the major technical thing the Pro gets your over the MacBook is a dedicated video card. The card in the MacBook uses part of your system memory and that's not a big deal if you aren't doing complex things like 3D Rendering or gaming. Even most photo editing tasks on the little MacBook will work well *if* you have enough RAM. I recommend 2GB or more.*|*|* My MacBook arrived and I couldn't be happier. I personally think the black is nicer looking than the aluminum model. And this thing is fast! It makes my dual Intel Windows tower at work seem pokey.*|*|* The glossy screen probably has more glare than a matte screen but the trade off in weight and size is well worth it.Also the built in wireless Airport is great and reception is wonderful. Just turn it on and  available networks show up in your menu. It's really so much nicer than Windows.*|*|* The bonus is that I can dual boot with BootCamp and run all my Windows stuff when I need to. I installed Neo Office (open source office suite) and now I can open and create all the documents for my coursework.*|*|* Don't fool yourself into thinking the less expensive MacBook is less worthy for general computing tasks than the more sophisticated pro. It's very elegant looking and very powerful. If you don't need the power and size of the pro, I think you'll be happy and the money you save can be put toward other things.

platforms. For the last ten years, my experience has been with MS based servers and workstations.  The last time I used an Apple personal computer was in 1980 when I owned an Apple II+.On a whim I purchased a MacBook running OS X 10.5.2 for my wife who has virtually no computer experience and avoids all things computer. She was not happy with my home MS Windows systems and she was not happy with the available portable computers running windows.She has taken to the MacBook like a duck takes to water.*|*|* She likes the package design, the display, and the desktop layout. She does not have the experience to appreciate the thoughtful interfaces and bundled applications that come with OS X.  She just knows the entire package is enjoyable and not intimidating.*|*|* Me - I like the UNIX foundation to OS-X.  Knowing the internals of both operating systems, UNIX is the clear winner when it comes to reliability, durability, predictability, consistency, and security.  Additionally, UNIX (with its open source variants) does not suffer from conflict of interest between operating systems and applications.  One always wonders if some MS Windows quirk exists to solve a development problem in some MS application.  I quickly put the terminal icon on the MacBook desktop so I could indulge myself with the UNIX shell command line any time I want ;-).*|*|* I installed a third party wireless router and configured internet services on the MacBook in a few minutes.  I also added a third party optical bluetooth mouse in about thirty seconds. It took longer to install the mouse batteries than configure the MacBook bluetooth capability.*|*|* Apple has a very solid package with the current MacBook. There is little that one needs to add to the MacBook.  It comes with just about every hardware interface available today.  It has ample processor, RAM, and hard disk storage for average users.  It comes with dual layer DVD RW. The bundled suite of applications is adequate for the full spectrum of casual computing (e.g., web browsing, email, chat, word processing, photo/video/audio processing).*|*|*  Apple stuff is a bit pricy but you receive the value you pay for.If you want a good comprehensive companion book for your MacBook, I recommend David Pogue\'s "Mac OS X Leopard: The Missing Manual".  This book is large and contains much technical detail but is very well written.  It is not for the casual computing novice that finds reading and comprehension tedious.I have used Apple support one time and found the wait to be acceptable and support engineer to be competent, efficient and attentive.  I have used MS support many times over the years and found them to be equally capable.*|*|* I have not found anything I dislike about the MacBook after thirty days of usage.  My wife, however, would like the Apple logo on the lid to glow red instead of white when the MacBook is powered up.', 'realTags': [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], 'predictedTags': [], 'sentences': ['I am a software engineer with twenty years experience developing system services for MS Windows and generic UNIX platforms', 'For the last ten years my experience has been with MS based servers and workstations', 'The last time I used an Apple personal computer was in 1980 when I owned an Apple II ', 'On a whim I purchased a MacBook running OS X 10.5', '2 for my wife who has virtually no computer experience and avoids all things computer', 'She was not happy with my home MS Windows systems and she was not happy with the available portable computers running windows', 'She has taken to the MacBook like a duck takes to water', 'She likes the package design the display and the desktop layout', 'She does not have the experience to appreciate the thoughtful interfaces and bundled applications that come with OS X', ' She just knows the entire package is enjoyable and not intimidating', 'Me I like the UNIX foundation to OS X', 'Knowing the internals of both operating systems UNIX is the clear winner when it comes to reliability durability predictability consistency and security', 'Additionally UNIX with its open source variants does not suffer from conflict of interest between operating systems and applications', 'One always wonders if some MS Windows quirk exists to solve a development problem in some MS application', 'I quickly put the terminal icon on the MacBook desktop so I could indulge myself with the UNIX shell command line any time I want ', 'I installed a third party wireless router and configured internet services on the MacBook in a few minutes', 'I also added a third party optical bluetooth mouse in about thirty seconds', 'It took longer to install the mouse batteries than configure the MacBook bluetooth capability', 'Apple has a very solid package with the current MacBook', 'There is little that one needs to add to the MacBook', 'It comes with just about every hardware interface available today', 'It has ample processor RAM and hard disk storage for average users', 'It comes with dual layer DVD RW', 'The bundled suite of applications is adequate for the full spectrum of casual computing e.g', ' web browsing email chat word processing photo video audio processing ', 'Apple stuff is a bit pricy but you receive the value you pay for', "If you want a good comprehensive companion book for your MacBook I recommend David Pogue's Mac OS X Leopard The Missing Manual ", 'This book is large and contains much technical detail but is very well written', 'It is not for the casual computing novice that finds reading and comprehension tedious', 'I have used Apple support one time and found the wait to be acceptable and support engineer to be competent efficient and attentive', 'I have used MS support many times over the years and found them to be equally capable', 'I have not found anything I dislike about the MacBook after thirty days of usage', 'My wife however would like the Apple logo on the lid to glow red instead of white when the MacBook is powered up'], 'k': 18, 'predictedLDASentenceTags': [[4], [3], [4], [11], [0], [4], [10], [5], [4], [5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [3], [1], [4], [10], [3], [9], [16], [4], [10], [1], [9], [0], [1], [9], [8], [10], [9], [4], [13], [13], [10], [10]]}

threads)* 4GB of RAM (Upgradable to 8GB RAM, using DDR3 PC3-8500 204-pin SODIMM)* Two USB 3.0 ports* HDMI port* Bluetooth 3.0 (I was able to do BT file-transfer from my cell)* NVIDIA GeForce 330M graphics with 1GB of memory* Samsung's True2Sound (Impressive, but sound is not that loud)* 802.11n, for faster wireless network* Jumbo frames support on LAN* No heat issue* UPDATE: I haven't even paid attention to the Apps.* I love that Samsung included some recovery apps, for drivers &/or OS (Samsung Recovery Solution 5)* I also admired that very little bloatware is installed, so far I only uninstalled Norton*|*|* Cons:* No Blu-ray reader* No eSATA port* Resolution is not 1080p, it is 720p (1366 x 768)* 5400RPM SATA Hard drive* Was told by Samsung that you cannot install SSD HD. I don't think this is accurate(?)* Samsung's Web site and support is lacking* Battery life* No keyboard backlight* *|*|* Not a big deal: Windows 7 Home PremiumI'm gonna install my own version of W7 Enterprise, also using Samsung Recovery Solution to restore drivers/apps.

I've had this computer for two weeks now and it is used several hours each day.*|*|*  I love that the RAM is upgradeable to 8gb, even though it runs beautifully fast with 4gb.  The screen is great and I like the non-shiny finish of the screen, so there is no glare at all.  The keyboard is the perfect size (for my regular-sized girl hands), and I really prefer the scrolly pad that the Toshibas have over other brands I have used.*|*|* This is the third Toshiba laptop in my household.  We have absolutely loved all of them.  This new one is definitely incredible, and the best of the bunch.  The things that I find they all have in common are - They stay very cool  (I use them all on laptop stands, mostly Rolodex Laptop Stands) and they are beautiful.The A505-S6973 is no exception.*|*|*  This laptop comes equipped with everything I could possibly need and more hard drive than I will ever use.*|*|*  I didn't find that there was too much junk I had to uninstall...just the usual Norton hogzilla software and some internet type software (netzero) that seems to always come on computers these days.  I usually have to spend the better part of the day uninstalling, updating, installing my own security software, and cleaning up.  With this laptop I only spent a couple of hours with all of that.*|*|* The speed of the processor is wonderful.  The premium speakers are quite noticeable as it seems like most mid-range laptops have junky speakers.  I would actually listen to music or watch a movie on this one without even having to plug in my headphones.*|*|* Lastly, this is one beautiful laptop.  The shiny black finish on the exterior top and the inside has a cool, subdued, lined design on it that you don't see in the online pictures.  It is sleek and smart looking.  It feels solid and well-built.*|*|*  I would not hesitate to recommend this laptop.  I have had the best of experiences with every Toshiba brand product I've had over the years and the 3 laptops in my household, now including this one, are stellar in their performance.", 'realTags': [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], 'predictedTags': [], 'sentences': ['First of all this ia a LOT of computer for the price', "I've had this computer for two weeks now and it is used several hours each day", 'I love that the RAM is upgradeable to 8gb even though it runs beautifully fast with 4gb', 'The screen is great and I like the non shiny finish of the screen so there is no glare at all', 'The keyboard is the perfect size for my regular sized girl hands and I really prefer the scrolly pad that the Toshibas have over other brands I have used', 'This is the third Toshiba laptop in my household', 'We have absolutely loved all of them', 'This new one is definitely incredible and the best of the bunch', 'The things that I find they all have in common are They stay very cool I use them all on laptop stands mostly Rolodex Laptop Stands and they are beautiful', 'The A505 S6973 is no exception', 'This laptop comes equipped with everything I could possibly need and more hard drive than I will ever use', "I didn't find that there was too much junk I had to uninstall just the usual Norton hogzilla software and some internet type software netzero that seems to always come on computers these days", 'I usually have to spend the better part of the day uninstalling updating installing my own security software and cleaning up', 'With this laptop I only spent a couple of hours with all of that', 'The speed of the processor is wonderful', 'The premium speakers are quite noticeable as it seems like most mid range laptops have junky speakers', 'I would actually listen to music or watch a movie on this one without even having to plug in my headphones', 'Lastly this is one beautiful laptop', "The shiny black finish on the exterior top and the inside has a cool subdued lined design on it that you don't see in the online pictures", 'It is sleek and smart looking', 'It feels solid and well built', 'I would not hesitate to recommend this laptop', "I have had the best of experiences with every Toshiba brand product I've had over the years and the 3 laptops in my household now including this one are stellar in their performance"], 'k': 18, 'predictedLDASentenceTags': [[4], [10], [0], [10], [16], [6], [9], [1], [17], [16], [8], [13], [3], [8], [9], [14], [16], [5], [8], [13], [2], [16], [4]]}

It typically runs all four cores at 3 Ghz and can run a single core at as high as 3.3 Ghz2) Expandable: I immediately put in 8 more GB of RAM for 16 GB total. Note - I had to remove the keyboard to get to one of the extra RAM slots - no big dealIt also has an Ultrabay - be sure to get the $60 hard disk adapter - and I threw in another 500GB 7200RPM drive.3) It has 2 USB 3 ports, as well as 1 eSATA/USB combo powered port. This means I can boot from an external 2.5 " hard drive via a special cable (sold on Amazon).4) It has an mSATA slot for an internal WAN modem OR Micro SSD card - nice!5) The screen is high resolution and very bright LED back lit.

including most of the smart phones and mp3 players in recent years but I have not bought a new laptop in 10 years. I say this only because this seems to be the first review, first let me say that my wife went back to school and needed a decent laptop. Now she can mess up a computer in about 20 seconds and for her I decided to get a MacBook air.*|*|* IT has a 13.3 screen 128gb ssd 4gb ram and the new intel I5 1.8 ghz. .She loves it and even it even works for her.I was going to buy a second MacBook but decided not to for two reasons  It seems the retinal display is under powered by the intel graphics card {this is the over all impression I got while doing research] and the cost.The same computer as the vaio I bought was 800$ more.*|*|* First let me say,the set up was a breeze. As with any new computer a lot of updates were needed and because the boot up time is in seconds it was ready for use in less than 1/2 hour.*|*|* There was some confusing details on the specks so I did a lot of research I went to both the intel and sony web sites and I learned as much as I could about the hardware that comes with this computer.*|*|* First of all this processor was releasted in the first part of 2013 as a replacement for the newer ultrabooks.It is an Intel I7 2 ghz processor with 4mg cache. THey also make a I5 1.8 ghz 3mb cache. According to what I was able to learn from the Intel website both of these processors run 100 MHz faster and also the video card runs 50 MHz faster. also it runs at 17 volts so it uses very little power. I will admit ,this ultrabook is very fast and runs cold. so far It also has a fairly quiet fan.*|*|* The touch screen is very responsive and I compare this to the Ipad 3 I can't comment on the touch pad or keyboard but they seem to be fine.*|*|* This computer is 3.7 pounds which is about 2/3 pound more than the MacBook air but it feels way more solid especially using the touch screen.This computer has almost too many ports but I cant complain. In appearance, if the MacBook air is sexy this vaio is sleek.*|*|* I have used a external blu ray drive and a 1TB passport on the 3.0 usb they both installed very fast. the new 3.0 port is amazing. one important aspect in buying a computer with a ssd dive is that the windows and supplied apps use about 50-68 gb od memory.*|*|* in conclusion my first impression has been very positive,every thing seems to work as expected , both apps and hardware were easy to install. the only thing I would suggest is getting a 256 gb ssd hard  drive oh by the way did I say this machine boots up way too fast.*|*|* I may write a follow up to this review if most people think this review is acceptable One last note, because I spent 2 extra days doing research,when I went to buy it.The cost was 110$ less thanks", 'realTags': [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], 'predictedTags': [], 'sentences': ['I have a lot of gadgets over the last 20 years including most of the smart phones and mp3 players in recent years but I have not bought a new laptop in 10 years', 'I say this only because this seems to be the first review first let me say that my wife went back to school and needed a decent laptop', 'Now she can mess up a computer in about 20 seconds and for her I decided to get a MacBook air', 'IT has a 13', '3 screen 128gb ssd 4gb ram and the new intel I5 1', '8 ghz', 'She loves it and even it even works for her', 'I was going to buy a second MacBook but decided not to for two reasons It seems the retinal display is under powered by the intel graphics card this is the over all impression I got while doing research and the cost', 'The same computer as the vaio I bought was 800 more', 'First let me say the set up was a breeze', 'As with any new computer a lot of updates were needed and because the boot up time is in seconds it was ready for use in less than 1 2 hour', 'There was some confusing details on the specks', 'so I did a lot of research I went to both the intel and sony web sites and I learned as much as I could about the hardware that comes with this computer', 'First of all this processor was releasted in the first part of 2013 as a replacement for the newer ultrabooks', 'It is an Intel I7 2 ghz processor with 4mg cache', 'THey also make a I5 1', '8 ghz 3mb cache', 'According to what I was able to learn from the Intel website both of these processors run 100 MHz faster and also the video card runs 50 MHz faster', 'also it runs at 17 volts so it uses very little power', 'I will admit this ultrabook is very fast and runs cold', ' so far It also has a fairly quiet fan', "The touch screen is very responsive and I compare this to the Ipad 3 I can't comment on the touch pad or keyboard but they seem to be fine", 'This computer is 3', '7 pounds which is about 2 3 pound more than the MacBook air but it feels way more solid especially using the touch screen', 'This computer has almost too many ports but I cant complain', 'In appearance if the MacBook air is sexy this vaio is sleek', 'I have used a external blu ray drive and a 1TB passport on the 3', '0 usb they both installed very fast', 'the new 3', '0 port is amazing', 'one important aspect in buying a computer with a ssd dive is that the windows and supplied apps use about 50 68 gb od memory', 'in conclusion my first impression has been very positive every thing seems to work as expected both apps and hardware were easy to install', 'the only thing I would suggest is getting a 256 gb ssd hard drive', 'oh by the way did I say this machine boots up way too fast', 'I may write a follow up to this review if most people think this review is acceptable One last note because I spent 2 extra days doing research when I went to buy it', 'The cost was 110 less thanks'], 'k': 18, 'predictedLDASentenceTags': [[1], [11], [9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [10], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [3], [10], [10], [6], [4], [12], [11], [9], [10], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [3], [2], [4], [5], [16], [12], [0], [10], [7], [10], [5], [3], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [8], [1], [6], [7], [6], [8], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]]}
