But even that started to feel big and heavy so when this one came out-- at this price!!!-- I pre-purchased.*|*|* I have been tracking discussions here and on the notebook review forums, and have some immediate answers to various concerns:1. it\'s 3 pounds six ounces with the battery. Feels like carrying a book.2. the wireless is intel 1000 bgn and has held steady and been very fast since I first got the computer.3. there\'s only one memory stick (2G) so you can easily pop in a second (which I did, before I even booted up the computer, for a grand total of $35.00) to bring the total memory to 4G.4. The keyboard is full sized, or, if it\'s smaller, the difference is so minimal I can\'t tell. It does seem to me that some of the edge keys (delete, tab, function keys) are smaller.5. It\'s crazy fast. My Windows Experence Index is:Processor 4.1Ram (with 4G) 4.8Graphics 3.5 (I\'m not bothered, but I\'m not a gamer)Gaming Graphics 3.3HDD 5.86. Touchpad does pinch zoom and is very responsive.*|*|* Have not installed all my software yet, but three hours of removing bloatware with the computer set on "high performance" and using WiFi leaves me with close to three hours of battery left.It\'s incredibly cool, meaning, in this case, temperature.In sum: I am in awe.*|*|* UDPATE: I have been using the laptop continually since my purchase. It continues to impress me with build quality and performance. I have been upgrading all our home computers to Windows 7, and I notice that the Intel card on this laptop finds the network more quickly than the gigabit ethernet card on my quad core desktop, and transfer speeds are as good as or better than the other wireless N cards in the house. So I think the people who have had trouble with the card may have gotten a bad card.*|*|* (Small comfort, I know...)I had some minor issues with the touchpad, which felt sticky and slow to me. I finally spent some time in the synaptics settings panel, changing the sensitivity and speed of the pointer, and now find it works very well for me. So if the touchpad is bothering you, give that a try.*|*|* I really like the keyboard-- my Dell xps m1330 often inserts an extra letter if I hit a key too hard, or, at the other end of the spectrum, misses a key. Never happens with this one.*|*|* More than one person, on seeing the computer, has thought I finally upgraded to Mac.*|*|* Note: Did a clean install of windows 7 from a usb drive, no problems, to get rid of bloatware.

{'features': [], 'review': "Edit: 3/26/08 - Five Stars *****Replacement unit is working perfectly!--------------------------------------*|*|* After a week of ownership I'll say this device does exactly what was expected and at a reasonable speed.  Hard drive could be a little faster during bootup, but is responsive during general use.  Given the tiny keyboard, don't expect this to be a laptop replacement.. rather a very portable computer for those not requiring lots of data entry.I planned to use mine for couchtop browsing, light email, portable media entertainment, and to perform mobile wireless surveys for my occupation.*|*|*  By many accounts the previous gen Q1's and OQO's A110 cpu is underpowered, so I chose the Q1UP with a Core Solo processor.PROs: ---Processor is well matched to the machine (no speed demon but not slow either).  Programs start quickly, DVD rips play without stutter.*|*|* Beautiful and bright screen, web pages fit nicely width-wise and buttons make scrolling easy.  Small fonts are extremely clear and readable (though some may have trouble with this).  DVD rips and photos look great. (A remote would be nice!)  Passive digitizer works well, and unlike my other tablet's active screen I love being able to use my fingers, reducing stylus usage somewhat.  Haven't really done any inking so can't comment on palm-on-the-screen issues.*|*|*  You can play Solitaire with a finger!With it's PSP-like shape it looks like it will be fun to play games.  Mouse can be switched to joystick mode with a button press.  Don't load Oblivion though.. its not meant for high-end 3D games.*|*|* Rear camera quality (1.3mp) is surprisingly good, at least as viewed from the screen.  Front facing camera (0.3mp) is of decent quality and more than adequate for video chat.*|*|* Split-Qwerty thumb-keyboard:  fine for short entry like URLs, filenames and short emails.  Thank goodness this is the improved kb, as anything less would be quite difficult.  Button size is similar to that of my Treo 700.  I wasn't expecting to get much typing done this way but its so much better than always having to do tablet entry.  Included is a program called 'Dialkeys' which throws a larger thumb-board on the screen and is better for longer entries.. it does eat up some screen space.*|*|*  Being left-handed, I like the mouse on the left.*|*|* Battery life seems good given this model comes with the extended battery.  Watched a 2 hour DVD rip with screen on full brightness and still had 3+ hours of regular usage left.  Rated life is 7.5 hours.*|*|* Comes with a USB cable for transferring files between computers.  Plug both ends in and Voila', a file-manager-like program appears on both machines allowing easy transfer of files.  No software installation necessary, it just works.*|*|* CONs: ---None really, except for an annoying problem with my unit:  (Update: Unit replaced, problem gone!)When picking up or otherwise handling the unit, the 'Play Camera' program starts and takes a picture.  (Should only happen when touching the shutter button)  Subsequent handling causes many pictures to be taken and after 5 minutes I might have 50 pics that need to be deleted.  No use killing the program, as it will usually start up again.  The shutter button moves freely and isn't bound up, so I don't understand why the slight case flexing causes it to take a picture.

With it's 500GB hard drive and 4G memory it's larger than any desktops we own, and faster too.Though I haven't had the Acer long, it is continually impressive.*|*|*  Out of the box, I was pleased to see it lacking in much of the bloatware that came on my HP netbook and Gateway laptop.  The desktop was blissfully vacant, leaving me to populate it with my own selections of programs.*|*|* Connecting to any WiFi has been a matter of a couple of clicks, including our sometimes difficult home wifi that treats new devices with deep suspicion.  The Acer was accepted onto our home network with no issues at all.*|*|* Whether loading on photos from sd, using the built-in webcam, or utilizing 3rd party readers such as Kindle for PC and Overdrive Media Console, everything works seamlessly.*|*|* I've read some reviews recently that laptops can run annoyingly hot, but that is not the case with the Acer.  It's quiet and cool, even when streaming videos.  If you are a person who, like me, is easily bothered by excessive electronic noise, you will especially appreciate this quiet little Acer.*|*|* A early drawback was the whiteness of the background.  Even after turning the brightness all the way down, the whiteness was too intense.  Fortunately, it is completely adjustable in the Control Panal where you can customize themes, colors etc. I was able to choose a background with a gentle glow much like the color on my favorite e-readers.*|*|* For many, the multi-gesture function is a good selling point and many will enjoy it. I, however, could not get accustomed to it and was happy to discover I could disable the features one by one until it functioned perfectly for me.*|*|* Certainly, this is not a high end laptop and it shows in the plastic and hinges, we well as the plug for the ac adapter.  I'm gentle plugging it in because the connection feels a little frail.  Same with transporting it. The shell is light plastic so I am extra careful.*|*|* But for such an outstanding low price it's worth it.  I only paid 250.00 for mine with a rebate, but it is a good value even at a higher price.*|*|* If you plan to listen to music or videos without headphones you'll want a good external speaker, but this is true for many laptops.  I used my Jawbone Jambox speaker and it sounded great. I don't think this Acer model has bluetooth, so I used a cord into the audio.*|*|* Comes with Windows 7.  Finally, Microsoft has produced an operating system I like almost as much as XP. It even has a built in security suite from Microsoft.And lastly, there are amazing desktop background photos including landscapes and screens from around the world that automatically rotate through the day.

I also want to mention that I have had VAIO, Compaq and ASUS between my wife and I.Normally I sell them used, in very good condition -excepting the last HP...

As with any new computer a lot of updates were needed and because the boot up time is in seconds it was ready for use in less than 1/2 hour.*|*|* There was some confusing details on the specks so I did a lot of research I went to both the intel and sony web sites and I learned as much as I could about the hardware that comes with this computer.*|*|* First of all this processor was releasted in the first part of 2013 as a replacement for the newer ultrabooks.It is an Intel I7 2 ghz processor with 4mg cache.

Overall I am extremely pleased with it and would highly recommend it to others.  Here\'s the breakdown:*|*|*PROS:- This is an extremely fast machine.  It boots up in under a minute with Windows 7 and I have yet to notice the occasional lag with starting up programs that I experience with most Windows PC\'s.- Newer games like "Dragon Age: Origins" run extremely well on this machine with all of the graphics maxed out-*|*|* The screen on this computer is beautiful.  The color quality and contrast are extremely good and there is a ton of screen real estate.  Some people have complained that it isn\'t full 1080p but I find that the 1680x945 resolution makes icons and text the perfect size for this size of screen.*|*|*- Multitasking works great with a dual-core processor (four virtual cores with hyperthreading) and 4GB of DDR3 RAM.  I routinely have 12 Firefox tabs up while watching videos in iTunes and editing four or five MS Office documents. A lot of computers don\'t like this but the Q860 handles it wonderfully.*|*|*- The battery life is over three hours, which is pretty good for such a behemoth.*|*|* CONS:- This is an extremely heavy laptop and I wouldn\'t recommend it for frequent business travel.  That being said, I do use this laptop for grad school and haul it back and forth to class one day a week using a Toshiba 18" gaming backpack and it isn\'t terrible on my back.  I would definitely recommend a backpack if you want to carry this thing around as a normal laptop shoulder bag would probably destroy your neck and shoulder.*|*|*- Both Toshiba and Amazon claim on their websites that this keyboard is backlit but unfortunately, it isn\'t.  Amazon customer service handled this issue extremely well after I reported it, so I can\'t complain about this too much.  All X505-series keyboards are compatible so you can probably pick up a backlit one off of eBay if that\'s a big deal to you.*|*|*- There is a decent amount of junkware pre-installed on this system, although not nearly as much as on the last Dell computer I bought.  It\'s kind of annoying that Toshiba does this on a high-performance computer that will probably be purchased by people that don\'t want or need it.*|*|* OVERALL:- I did a large amount of research before buying this laptop and as of this moment, there isn\'t a better value out there in gaming laptops than this.

For the last ten years, my experience has been with MS based servers and workstations.  The last time I used an Apple personal computer was in 1980 when I owned an Apple II+.On a whim I purchased a MacBook running OS X 10.5.2 for my wife who has virtually no computer experience and avoids all things computer. She was not happy with my home MS Windows systems and she was not happy with the available portable computers running windows.She has taken to the MacBook like a duck takes to water.*|*|* She likes the package design, the display, and the desktop layout. She does not have the experience to appreciate the thoughtful interfaces and bundled applications that come with OS X.  She just knows the entire package is enjoyable and not intimidating.*|*|* Me - I like the UNIX foundation to OS-X.  Knowing the internals of both operating systems, UNIX is the clear winner when it comes to reliability, durability, predictability, consistency, and security.  Additionally, UNIX (with its open source variants) does not suffer from conflict of interest between operating systems and applications.  One always wonders if some MS Windows quirk exists to solve a development problem in some MS application.  I quickly put the terminal icon on the MacBook desktop so I could indulge myself with the UNIX shell command line any time I want ;-).*|*|* I installed a third party wireless router and configured internet services on the MacBook in a few minutes.  I also added a third party optical bluetooth mouse in about thirty seconds. It took longer to install the mouse batteries than configure the MacBook bluetooth capability.*|*|* Apple has a very solid package with the current MacBook. There is little that one needs to add to the MacBook.  It comes with just about every hardware interface available today.  It has ample processor, RAM, and hard disk storage for average users.  It comes with dual layer DVD RW.

Be prepared: it\'s a large download (over 3 GB), although you can keep working until the very end of the update, which includes several computer restarts.

A Dell OEM program will prompt you to create your own using either the optical drive (for writing to DVD) or a USB port (for writing to a USB drive). You\'ll need to have at least 12 GB available.

I am very happy with the purchase.*|*|* The 17.3" screen is great and was a must-have for me. I have had a 17" laptop for a while and I wasn\'t going back! Obviously this makes it not quite as portable, but this sits at home most of the time and goes on trips with me. A 17" laptop is also a bit more difficult to find a carrying case for.*|*|* The fingerprint scanner was easy to set up and works very well every time I use it.Having a blu-ray drive as well as HDMI is fantastic, as I can use this as a blu-ray player at home.The speakers aren\'t quite as loud as I hoped, but they\'re certainly not quiet. I\'ve just heard a lot of talk about Beats Audio and was hoping for a little more volume. It\'s very clear at full volume with 0 static sound, so that\'s a plus.The keyboard is smooth and easy to type on and the mouse works well - as expected.*|*|* One thing I\'m not impressed with - multitouch. I have used a Mac multitouch mouse and they work very smoothly. This "multitouch" mouse is very spotty to the point of being almost useless. Do not consider the multitouch mouse a buying point - it rarely works properly. Even when it does work, the scrolling is entirely too fast to be useful.The overall design is very nice in my opinion.*|*|* I\'ve read a few places where people complain of the silver rim being cheap looking, and while it\'s not solid and unbreakable I think it looks good and won\'t be easy to break unless you drop the laptop or are very rough on it.*|*|* EDIT 9/9/2012: After some months of use, I was proven wrong. The plastic around the speakers on the front of the laptop do break. It\'s just a thin piece of plastic that broke off on both sides. Still, I\'m overall happy with the computer and would buy it again.*|*|* The HD webcam quality is OK. I don\'t think I\'d called it HD but probably a step under HD.The RAM is very easy to upgrade and the model I got had 1 4GB DDR3 stick with 1 empty slot - a cheaper upgrade than if it had 2 x 2GB sticks. There is a spot for a secondary hard drive, but I was disappointed to see that it did not include a cable to connect the 2nd hard drive to the laptop. This will have to be purchased separately, and I was able to find it online for $32 shipped.*|*|* This laptop runs very cool.

{'features': [], 'review': 'Long story short.  I wanted an inexpensive 11.6 inch notebook with Windows 7 to travel with and use in and around my home.  I found it with the Acer V5-131-2629.*|*|* When I discovered this Windows 7 laptop, I was excited to find that it was still available in mass quantities.  In fact, mine was manufactured only a couple of months ago.  I really didn\'t want to go the Windows 8 route for what I was trying to accomplish with this laptop.*|*|* This laptop had everything I was looking for; Windows 7 Home Premium, Intel Celeron 1007U 1.5 GHz dual core processor, 11.6" screen (1366x768), 4GB DDR3 ram memory, 500GB hard drive, Intel GMA HD Graphics, WIFI A, G, N and Bluetooth 4.0.  It also has three USB ports (2.0) and not 3.0 as advertised along with HDMI, VGA and Ethernet ports.*|*|*  It also comes with a 6-cell lithium ion battery with a battery life of 6.5 hours.  The battery does protrude at the bottom of the laptop, but in turn gives it a nice angle to use.  You can order a four cell battery replacement if you want a slimmer and flush look to the laptop at the expense of battery life.  I ordered one and will use the 6-cell battery as a spare.*|*|* The laptop itself has a great design and form factor.  If you have seen Acer\'s Chromebook C710 11.6" laptop, this is the same exact laptop, but in black and the inclusion of Windows 7. The chiclet keyboard and screen are very good.  It is very easy to open the back panel for any user upgrades such as upgrading the ram or hard drive to an SSD.  All you have to do is remove one screw and slide the back panel off.*|*|* After using this laptop, I\'m very pleased with it.  The Windows Experience Index rates it 4.4 out of the box with no upgrades. It is very fast and has no problems streaming 1080p video.  I have noticed no lag at all.*|*|* If you want the flexibility of a laptop without the limitations of a tablet, this Acer laptop offers lots of bang and a real good look for the buck.

It was barely adequate. I stepped up to a Treo 600, and then the 700p, but even with the accessory fold-out keyboards, it was still a chore to write blog entries and manage my e-mail. And while the cameras have improved, they\'re still pretty bad.I miss the 3G connectivity with the Mini 9, but Wifi hotspots are becoming more plentiful and it\'s getting easier to find them, especially if you have the AT&T; deal with Starbucks or McDonald\'s.*|*|* The SSD (solid state drive) seems perfect for motorcycle travel, since it has no moving parts and is, therefore, less vulnerable to damage from vibration.The 1GB of RAM and 8GB of SSD capacity are plenty, assuming you don\'t junk the Mini 9 up with lots of software. And there isn\'t any reason to do that, considering that you can do all of your email, word processing, spreadsheets, calendars, and other office-type functions up in "the cloud" with Google Apps.*|*|* I found the Internet Explorer browser\'s menu bars took up too much screen real estate, so I installed Google\'s streamlined Chrome browser that lets me see more of the web pages at a glance. I also avoid loading up the SSD by using an 8GB SanDisk thumb drive as a D: drive.*|*|* I\'m not much for touchpads - the Mini 9\'s touchpad works fine, I\'m just not a touchpad guy - so I use a wireless optical mouse.*|*|* The built-in webcam is surprisingly good. I have yet to use it for a live conversation, but it shoots quite acceptable still photos. The SD card reader is perfect for importing images from a higher-quality digital camera.*|*|* The smaller keyboard takes a little getting used to. The apostrophe and quote marks and dash/underscore are not where my fingers expected to find them, but it doesn\'t take long to make the synaptic adjustment.*|*|* The Mini 9 is intelligently designed when it comes to upgrades. You can access its guts by removing two screws and a cover plate on the underside. As I said, it comes with 1GB of RAM. You can double that for about $30 and the conversion takes about 5 minutes.*|*|* Computer development being what it is, there are sure to be subsequent generations of netbooks with more speed, power and versatility.

{'features': [], 'review': "I don't usually do reviews but this computer had no reviews and I love this machine.*|*|* One thing about the marketing page though. Amazon has it advertised as 1 TB 7200 Hard drive. Instead, it has 2 Western Digital 500 GB 7200 RPM drives which are very easy to access in terms of opening up the laptop and messing with hardware. I have not changed any hardware and do not intend to.*|*|* The screen is fantastic, the 1920x1080 res just makes everything look beautiful. The 17.3 inches is a little big but it's easy enough to carry around.*|*|* This laptop is not advertised as a gaming laptop but every game I have tried so far, Assassins Creed Franchise, Half Life 2, Team Fortress 2, and Sid Meier's Civilization 5, run perfectly with no lag even when running at full graphics. Today, I have spent almost 4 hours gaming without turning off or taking a break and the laptop external surface temp is room temperature if not a tad bit cooler.*|*|* The included subwoofer is a nice addition which virtually takes out all of the tinny sounds that laptops are almost infamous for. When I have blasted the speakers at their full capacity I was able to hear this laptop almost 75 ft away with no issues.*|*|* The computer does come with a decent amount of pre-installed software but nothing that can't be uninstalled via the control panel. Also, the side button on the side that can be programmed is very nice. Also, the case is classy and sophisticated. The brushed aluminium design makes the computer look sleek and professional.*|*|* I only have two complaints with it so far.1. The track pad. It looks nice and the concept with multi-gesture support is interesting, but it doesn't work. I don't like it. The pad is flimsy and a little over sized and the clicking is temperamental. However, this doesn't bother me too much because I use an external Logitech G500 mouse and I have disabled the track pad.2. The keyboard tends to stick when you press keys too hard but its barely noticeable when typing.*|*|* Overall, amazing laptop and I am very pleased with my purchase. If you are looking at the Asus N56VZ-DS71, the hardware is virtually the same, except for the hard drives and resolution size. I went with this one because the N56 has a 5400 rpm drive which causes severe bottleneck issues in terms of power.*|*|* On a side note, I was able to transfer roughly 50 GB of music from an external hard drive to this computer in under 10 minutes. I'm happy I spent the extra 100 dollars on this faster laptop, though I wish it was offered in the 16.3 inch size.*|*|* If you want to see an in depth video review, look up xoticpc Asus N76VZ-DS71 on youtube. They have a really nice 25 minute video review.*|*|* I chose to buy from amazon because at the time it was the better deal. Love the Asus name and this laptop.*|*|* UPDATEJust a couple things I have found after using this laptop for several months. It has an internal high quality microphone which I didn't realize at the time and that Amazon did not advertise.Also, I was mistaken, the hard drives are not western digital, they are seagate.When you buy this laptop, the two hard drives are partitioned into 4 hard drives each containing roughly 256 gb. This is one thing I do not like and I didn't realize it until after I bought it and installed all of my software on.

{'features': [], 'review': 'My wife and I got this Toshiba laptop to replace an aging laptop at home, where the extent of our mobility requirement is that we occasionally move it from room to room.  (If we simply wanted a computer for a fixed location, we probably would have purchased a desktop model for somewhat less money and/or better performance.)*|*|*  Beyond normal uses such as spreadsheets and publishing programs, the 2.2 GHz Intel Core Duo 2 T6600 processor is plenty powerful enough for typical household needs, including photography work and most games.  If you are a serious gamer, however, you will want more processing power and a discrete graphics card, which this laptop doesn\'t have.*|*|*  Unlike most netbooks or "ultra-thin" laptops (which slot between netbooks and traditional laptops), this unit comes with 4GB of memory, which should remain sufficient for several years, and a solid 400GB hard drive.  That, along with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, should last you years.*|*|* The large (16 inch) display is bright, crisp and a joy to behold.  I\'ve read some complaints about the keyboard, but we like it.  There is a numeric keypad, which really saves time if you frequently work with numbers.  The touchpad is not located in the middle of the unit, which troubles some people (although it is easy to get used to).  If you look carefully at an image of the keyboard, you will see that the touchpad is located roughly in the middle of what I would call the traditional keyboard area (from the left shift key to the right shift key), which is where you will normally find your hands when typing.  The two internal speakers are simply great for a laptop, but don\'t expect miracles from 1.5 inch speakers.  The "fusion" finish looks sharp, but it attracts fingerprints like honey attracts bees.*|*|* This Toshiba comes with a six-cell battery and an advertised 3 hours and 20 minute battery life, although we got closer to 2 hours and 30 minutes of battery use with normal settings.  Regardless, we don\'t run this on battery power that often, and if what you want is really long battery life, you should look at a netbook or ultra-thin.*|*|* The Windows 7 software is 64-bit, which is where personal computing is headed, so that\'s an advantage.  However, you may find some compatibility problems with older software or hardware such as printers (many printer manufacturers will have compatible drivers available shortly).*|*|* Before you rule this laptop in for your situation, however, you should first rule out various alternatives.  If mobility is a key concern for you, this isn\'t the right choice.  Yes, you can pick it up and carry it around, but at 15 inches in width and over seven pounds, I wouldn\'t want to lug it around for long.  For, say, a college student who wants to take notes in class every day (and who can accept the limited processing power of less capable machines), a smaller, lighter computer with much better battery life is a better choice.  Get a netbook, or maybe an ultra-thin.*|*|*  If you are a serious gamer or video editor, then you need a high-end machine with a discrete graphics card and a more powerful processor.  Just be prepared to pay up for it.*|*|*  And if you have no mobility requirement, consider a desktop.*|*|* However, if what you want is a desktop replacement laptop with plenty of memory, good processing power, speed, a large screen, a roomy hard drive, lots of ports, etc., then this laptop features an attractive combination of these features in a relatively economical package.

{'features': [], 'review': "I ordered the Acer Timeline 4810TZ-4508 to replace my two-year old Lenovo Thinkpad T61, and I love it!*|*|* Getting started was very easy.  It only took me about two hours to register Windows 7 Home Premium, upgrade to Windows 7 Professional (through the Anytime Upgrade feature), create factory default backup discs, remove some bloatware, and install some of my favorite programs.  After reading some of the reviews of the older models, I was worried about the prospect of flashing the BIOS or updating the VGA/LAN drivers, but my computer has worked fine without those updates.  I suspect that Acer may have fixed those problems for this model, since it's a new release with Windows 7.*|*|* Although the processor is ostensibly slower than the Intel Core 2 Duo processor in my T61, I had to underclock the T61 because it tended to overheat and shut down.  With this Timeline, I'm able to run the processor at full speed without any heating or cooling problems.  The computer is surprisingly zippy.  I found that I was able to listen to music, convert tracks on iTunes, surf the web, and install programs all at the same time, without any noticeable lag in performance.  Full screen streaming video on [...] and [...] also looked fantastic, without any jerkiness or skipping.  (In fact, video playback was better than on my Thinkpad which, notwitstanding the faster processor, had less RAM and a slower video card.)*|*|*  The screen is very bright, and even at the dimmest setting, I was surprised with how much clearer it was than my old Thinkpad.  It is a glossy screen, however, which means that it looks great indoors but is very difficult to use outdoors.  I have found the glare a bit distracting, but not a deal-breaker.  I don't play computer games, so I can't say anything about its performance in that regard.*|*|* Of course, one of the main reasons I purchased the Timeline was for portability, and it really doesn't disappoint.  The laptop is noticeably thinner and lighter than my T61 - I think the total weight is about 4 lbs. and it's just over an inch thick.*|*|*  Acer wasn't kidding about the battery life:  I spent 4.5 hours today at Starbucks surfing the web, listening to music, and using Microsoft Word with the screen at medium brightness, and still had 45% battery by the end.  I am sure that I could get about 8-9 hours of total battery life, if I minimized all the settings.  After fighting for power outlets and worrying about tripping over power cords with my Thinkpad, this is a refreshing change.*|*|* Coming from using the T61's fantastic keyboard, I was kind of nervous about this chiclet-style design, but I easily got used to it.  The keys give a lot of tactile feedback, and they are well-enough spaced that you don't hint the wrong keys.  The touchpad, however, is a bit difficult to use, and I'm still getting used to the stiffness of the touchpad button.Overall, this is a fantastic computer, and a great value at the price.*|*|*  I think if you are considering the different 14 inch models, the 4810TZ-4508 has some advantages over the cheaper/older models:  more RAM, faster processor, 64-bit Windows 7 Home Premium, and newer drivers.", 'realTags': [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], 'predictedTags': [], 'sentences': ['I ordered the Acer Timeline 4810TZ 4508 to replace my two year old Lenovo Thinkpad T61 and I love it', 'Getting started was very easy', 'It only took me about two hours to register Windows 7 Home Premium upgrade to Windows 7 Professional through the Anytime Upgrade feature create factory default backup discs remove some bloatware and install some of my favorite programs', 'After reading some of the reviews of the older models I was worried about the prospect of flashing the BIOS or updating the VGA LAN drivers but my computer has worked fine without those updates', "I suspect that Acer may have fixed those problems for this model since it's a new release with Windows 7", 'Although the processor is ostensibly slower than the Intel Core 2 Duo processor in my T61 I had to underclock the T61 because it tended to overheat and shut down', "With this Timeline I'm able to run the processor at full speed without any heating or cooling problems", 'The computer is surprisingly zippy', 'I found that I was able to listen to music convert tracks on iTunes surf the web and install programs all at the same time without any noticeable lag in performance', 'Full screen streaming video on and also looked fantastic without any jerkiness or skipping', 'In fact video playback was better than on my Thinkpad which notwitstanding the faster processor had less RAM and a slower video card', 'The screen is very bright and even at the dimmest setting I was surprised with how much clearer it was than my old Thinkpad', 'It is a glossy screen however which means that it looks great indoors but is very difficult to use outdoors', 'I have found the glare a bit distracting but not a deal breaker', "I don't play computer games so I can't say anything about its performance in that regard", "Of course one of the main reasons I purchased the Timeline was for portability and it really doesn't disappoint", 'The laptop is noticeably thinner and lighter than my T61 I think the total weight is about 4 lbs', "and it's just over an inch thick", "Acer wasn't kidding about the battery life I spent 4", '5 hours today at Starbucks surfing the web listening to music and using Microsoft Word with the screen at medium brightness and still had 45 battery by the end', 'I am sure that I could get about 8 9 hours of total battery life if I minimized all the settings', 'After fighting for power outlets and worrying about tripping over power cords with my Thinkpad this is a refreshing change', "Coming from using the T61's fantastic keyboard I was kind of nervous about this chiclet style design but I easily got used to it", "The keys give a lot of tactile feedback and they are well enough spaced that you don't hint the wrong keys", "The touchpad however is a bit difficult to use and I'm still getting used to the stiffness of the touchpad button", 'Overall this is a fantastic computer and a great value at the price', 'I think if you are considering the different 14 inch models the 4810TZ 4508 has some advantages over the cheaper older models more RAM faster processor 64 bit Windows 7 Home Premium and newer drivers'], 'k': -1, 'predictedLDASentenceTags': []}

Arrived late due to FedEx, not the fault of Amazon, Warehouse Sur+ or Acer, of course. It was double boxed for shipping, arrived in excellent condition.*|*|* Excellent finish which makes smudges hard to see. Screen is nice and big, crystal clear. We have 4 Acer monitors and all work very well. Not a single issue with them and two are several years old, so we were pretty sure Acer would make a good laptop as well.*|*|* The laptop comes with Windows 7 Home Premium but no DVD for it so you can't reinstall easily. The key code for it is on a sticker on the bottom of the laptop, so if you get an OEM Windows 7 DVD that key should work to reinstall Windows 7.*|*|* It also comes with some craplets, but you might be interested in McAfee's antivirus (we weren't, we use Microsofts Security Essentials, free download from MS with an authenticated Windows system).We reformatted the hard drive into multiple partitions and installed Windows 7 64bit Ultimate (we use BitLocker drive data encryption for data on the laptop and on the USB drives).*|*|* The reformat and reinstall worked just fine (and no craplets!). Since there is no disk with the system, there were a lot of missing drivers (for the network card, wireless device, several Intel drivers, the camera, etc). All were easy to find at the Acer web site (get them beforehand, unless you have another computer to download with).Once we added the network driver, we could instantly see the local network computers and printers, and internet. Once that was found, we went to Microsoft Updates and that seemed to find most the other drivers for updating, including the video card drivers. The Acer website for the AS5742Z lists drivers for both AMD video cards and nVidia, although you probably don't want or need both, and they are large files. The Microsoft Update website detected and installed the appropriate video driver, which makes life a lot easier.*|*|* If you decide you want to install Windows XP (we tried just to check if it works) it does run fine, although we did have to go into the BIOS at bootup and change the SATA setting to IDE. The default value crashes XP during installation. That's a minor issue, since Windows 7 is so much better anyway. If you use the normal 32 bit XP, you won't use all of the 4GB of ram; you need the 64 bit operating systems to do that, which is why Acer provides the Windows 7 64 bit version.*|*|* The laptop has 3 USB ports, two on the right side, one on the left. We put USB thumbnail drives into them all to test them and had no issues. We tried the wireless network, it was fine. We also connected to our 10/100/1000 wired network, and the laptop transferred a large file at the full 1Gbps speed. We then tried a wireless modem from Verizon, and it also worked as expected.*|*|* The keyboard is very nice for a laptop. The mouse pad on the laptop is ok, but we prefer a normal mouse. We put in a USB mouse made by Roswell (a cheapo one for $4) and it worked right away.*|*|* The 4GB of RAM were fully accessible, thanks to the 64 bit operating system (both on the OEM version it came with and our own Win7 64 Ultimate).The only thing we will get for it is a car charger.

{'features': [], 'review': "For the price you can't go wrong !*|*|*  Now for a little details: The AMD Quad-Core A6-3400M Accelerated Processor with AMD Radeon HD 6520G Graphics at 2.3 GHz, 4MB Cache , basically the speed and efficiency of this processor ranks somewhere in between an INTEL core i3 and INTEL core i5-2510M closer to i5 than i3 . Running your basic word processing, web browsing (with multiple tabs open) spread sheets etc, you will never tell the difference between AMD and INTEL , now INTEL sandy bridge core i processors are generally faster at cpu intensive applications like video trans-coding and 3D rendering (most people don't do unassisted video trans-coding and 3d rendering if you do I suggest you go for an INTEL core i5 or i7 processor) where the AMD stands out is in its graphics performance it wont run the latest games at high settings but it does a good job (the quad core and better integrated graphics helps) look at Ramanspec Jerry's review for more detail on gaming performance .*|*|* Battery life is very good as advertised 5hrs . Build quality is good not the best I have seen and touched but sturdy and battery secured properly, I won't comment on the aesthetics cause that's based on user preference/taste .*|*|* Simply put if you are looking for an inexpensive laptop with good battery life that can do what most users could throw at it with good performance and want to fire up a game now and then, for the price, this laptop can't be beat .", 'realTags': [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], 'predictedTags': [], 'sentences': ["For the price you can't go wrong", 'Now for a little details The AMD Quad Core A6 3400M Accelerated Processor with AMD Radeon HD 6520G Graphics at 2', '3 GHz 4MB Cache basically the speed and efficiency of this processor ranks somewhere in between an INTEL core i3 and INTEL core i5 2510M closer to i5 than i3 ', "Running your basic word processing web browsing with multiple tabs open spread sheets etc you will never tell the difference between AMD and INTEL now INTEL sandy bridge core i processors are generally faster at cpu intensive applications like video trans coding and 3D rendering most people don't do unassisted video trans coding and 3d rendering if you do I suggest you go for an INTEL core i5 or i7 processor where the AMD stands out is in its graphics performance it wont run the latest games at high settings but it does a good job the quad core and better integrated graphics helps look at Ramanspec Jerry's review for more detail on gaming performance ", 'Battery life is very good as advertised 5hrs ', "Build quality is good not the best I have seen and touched but sturdy and battery secured properly I won't comment on the aesthetics cause that's based on user preference taste ", "Simply put if you are looking for an inexpensive laptop with good battery life that can do what most users could throw at it with good performance and want to fire up a game now and then for the price this laptop can't be beat "], 'k': -1, 'predictedLDASentenceTags': []}
{'features': [], 'review': "I went back and forth between the MacBook and MacBook Pro. Which one? Will it be powerful enough? Big enough...?Maybe a Sony Vaio would be better?I'm a Windows software developer but I'm going back to school for my MBA and I wanted a smaller, simple notebook for papers and internet communication for classwork. It needs to be durable and I need it to work without a lot of fussing around with system bits.After much research I chose the MacBook over the pro because of the smaller size and the fact that the aluminum on the pro although cool, can dent easily.*|*|* The matte black finish on the MacBook is elegant, tough, and the build quality it top notch. Does the the black eventually get smears on it from your hands and fingers? Yes it does but just wipe them off every so often. It's not a big deal.*|*|* IMO, aside from a few points in processor speed the major technical thing the Pro gets your over the MacBook is a dedicated video card. The card in the MacBook uses part of your system memory and that's not a big deal if you aren't doing complex things like 3D Rendering or gaming. Even most photo editing tasks on the little MacBook will work well *if* you have enough RAM. I recommend 2GB or more.*|*|* My MacBook arrived and I couldn't be happier. I personally think the black is nicer looking than the aluminum model. And this thing is fast! It makes my dual Intel Windows tower at work seem pokey.*|*|* The glossy screen probably has more glare than a matte screen but the trade off in weight and size is well worth it.Also the built in wireless Airport is great and reception is wonderful. Just turn it on and  available networks show up in your menu. It's really so much nicer than Windows.*|*|* The bonus is that I can dual boot with BootCamp and run all my Windows stuff when I need to. I installed Neo Office (open source office suite) and now I can open and create all the documents for my coursework.*|*|* Don't fool yourself into thinking the less expensive MacBook is less worthy for general computing tasks than the more sophisticated pro. It's very elegant looking and very powerful. If you don't need the power and size of the pro, I think you'll be happy and the money you save can be put toward other things.

{'features': [], 'review': 'These are all early observations, since the PC only recently arrived.First impression was slightly disappointing. The mocha color is very dark brown, almost black. It isn\'t as distinctive looking as I had imagined. The case, however, is textured aluminum, obviously designed to be rugged as well as handsome.*|*|* The next impression was very favorable. The screen is very bright, clear, and easy to read. Colors seem to be accurate without any adjustment. While the screen is shiny, it is not a mirror like so many laptops these days, more like a typical LCD TV screen.*|*|* The unit is heavy, but I don\'t think anyone buys a 17" laptop for extreme portability.*|*|* Everything works flawlessly. The keyboard is comfortable for typing, and the touchpad seems very precise in interpreting finger movements.The sound from the built-in speakers is amazing when bass and surround are set to maximum. Not quite hi-fi but good for listening to music while working.*|*|* The speed would probably not be adequate for a gamer, but is impressive when moving up from an older PC.
